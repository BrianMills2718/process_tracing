  Theda Skocpol's structural theory of social revolutions.
  States and Social Revolutions (1979) argues that revolutions result from
  the conjunction of state fiscal/military crisis, elite defection from the
  regime, and autonomous popular mobilization — not from ideology or
  vanguard leadership alone. External pressure (war, geopolitical competition)
  creates the opening; institutional weakness determines whether the old
  regime can absorb or deflect the crisis.

outcome_variable: revolution

variables:
  - name: fiscal_crisis
    description: >
      State faces severe fiscal strain — inability to fund military,
      administration, or debt service. Tax system inadequate or collapsing.
    description_zero: >
      State finances are stable or manageable; no acute revenue crisis.
    observable_indicators:
      - Government bankruptcy or inability to pay soldiers/officials
      - Emergency taxation or forced loans
      - Debt default or near-default
      - Currency debasement or hyperinflation

  - name: elite_defection
    description: >
      Significant faction of the ruling elite (nobility, military officers,
      senior bureaucrats, wealthy bourgeoisie) withdraws support from the
      regime or actively opposes it.
    description_zero: >
      Elite remain broadly loyal to the regime; no major splits.
    observable_indicators:
      - Elite-led assemblies or councils demanding reform
      - Military officers refusing orders or joining opposition
      - Wealthy elites funding revolutionary movements
      - Noble/elite participation in revolutionary governance

  - name: popular_mobilization
    description: >
      Autonomous mass mobilization — peasant revolts, urban uprisings,
      worker strikes — not controlled by elites or the state.
    description_zero: >
      No significant autonomous popular uprising; protests are small,
      localized, or elite-directed.
    observable_indicators:
      - Large-scale peasant land seizures or rural revolts
      - Urban crowd actions (bread riots, storming of buildings)
      - General strikes or mass demonstrations
      - Formation of popular militias or committees

  - name: external_pressure
    description: >
      Geopolitical or military pressure from foreign powers — war,
      invasion threat, colonial exploitation, or economic sanctions
      that weakens the state.
    description_zero: >
      No significant external military or geopolitical threat to the state.
    observable_indicators:
      - Ongoing or recent war draining state resources
      - Military defeat or humiliation
      - Foreign occupation or colonial control
      - Economic pressure from foreign powers

  - name: institutional_weakness
    description: >
      State institutions (bureaucracy, military, judiciary) are rigid,
      corrupt, or incapable of reform — cannot absorb demands or
      adapt to crisis.
    description_zero: >
      State institutions are flexible, reformist, or capable of
      managing the crisis through adaptation.
    observable_indicators:
      - Failed reform attempts
      - Corruption scandals undermining legitimacy
      - Bureaucratic paralysis during crisis
      - Military fragmentation or inability to maintain order

  - name: revolution
    description: >
      A social revolution occurs — fundamental transformation of state
      structure AND class relations, not merely a change of government
      (coup) or political reform.
    description_zero: >
      No revolution; the regime survives through reform, repression,
      or the crisis passes without fundamental transformation.
    observable_indicators:
      - Old regime overthrown (not just reshuffled)
      - New state institutions created
      - Major redistribution of property or class power
      - New constitution or fundamental legal transformation
