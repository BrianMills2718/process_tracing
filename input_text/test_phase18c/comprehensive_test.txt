The Boston Tea Party occurred on December 16, 1773, when American colonists dumped 342 chests of tea into Boston Harbor to protest British taxation without representation. This act of defiance was organized by the Sons of Liberty, led by Samuel Adams and John Hancock.

Parliament responded in 1774 with the Intolerable Acts, which closed Boston Harbor and revoked Massachusetts' charter. These punitive measures further angered colonists throughout the thirteen colonies.

The colonial response was swift and unified. The First Continental Congress convened in Philadelphia in September 1774, bringing together delegates from twelve colonies to coordinate resistance to British policies.

This escalation of tensions set the stage for armed conflict, beginning with the battles of Lexington and Concord in April 1775, ultimately leading to the Declaration of Independence in 1776.
