The Boston Tea Party and American Revolution

The Boston Tea Party occurred on December 16, 1773, when colonists dumped tea into Boston Harbor. This event was caused by the Tea Act which gave the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in America.

Samuel Adams organized the Sons of Liberty who carried out the Tea Party. King George III responded by passing the Intolerable Acts which closed Boston Harbor.

The Tea Act created economic pressure on colonial merchants. This economic pressure led to organized resistance. The organized resistance eventually caused the American Revolution.

Evidence shows that taxation without representation motivated the colonists. Parliamentary records confirm that the Tea Act was designed to assert British authority. The Boston Tea Party demonstrates colonial willingness to resist British policies through direct action.

Alternative explanations suggest that economic self-interest rather than constitutional principles motivated colonial resistance. However, evidence from working-class participation refutes this economic self-interest theory.
