Legitimacy Vacuum Theory (original)

When a regime loses legitimacy across ALL social strata simultaneously — not just
popular discontent (which is common) but also elite defection AND institutional
self-doubt (officials themselves no longer believe in the system's right to rule) —
a "legitimacy vacuum" forms. In this vacuum, the outcome is determined NOT by who
has the strongest ideology or the deepest grievances, but by who can most credibly
perform sovereignty: visibly exercising authority in the public space while others
hesitate. The first actor to fill the vacuum with a plausible performance of
legitimate authority captures the state, regardless of whether their actual power
base is military, popular, institutional, or ideological.

Key predictions that distinguish this from standard theories:
- The winning actor need not have the largest army, the most popular support, or
  the best institutional position — they must be the first to ACT decisively while
  others deliberate.
- There should be evidence of multiple factions that COULD have seized power but
  hesitated or sought permission/legitimacy before acting.
- The winning actor's rhetoric should emphasize restoration of order and legitimate
  authority, not revolutionary transformation or personal ambition.
- The speed of the takeover should be disproportionate to the winner's actual
  resources — the vacuum does the work, not the force.
