hello and welcome to the Westminster Institute I'm Robert Riley its director some 10 months ago we sponsored
a program on the future of Ukraine in the form of a debate with two very
distinguished foreign policy experts who hold markedly different perspectives on
Ukraine on the cause of the war the conduct of the war and its likely
outcome a lot has happened in the last 10 months in Ukraine and Russia so I'm
delighted that these two gentlemen agreed to return to do another program
on this subject uh as that show we taped more than 10 months ago was very Lively I
have every expectation that our program today uh will be quite Lively as well
one of our guests is Herman persner he is the president of the American foreign
policy Council uh which was founded back in 1982 in
Washington uh to provide some wellth thought out perspectives on foreign policy
questions in 82 Herman was the president of American foreign policy Council and
today more than 40 years later he remains as the president of this important and distinguished group now uh
Herman has held other significant positions as well senior Senate staff
and as director of the National Security team advising former presidential
candidate and former Speaker of the House new Gingrich the afpc American
foreign policy Council also publishes a great deal of material from its senior
fellows and Senior Management uh in the form of monographs and books uh or
shorter papers for briefing uh Herman has hosted hundreds
of delegations from foreign countries to come to the United States to meet senior
uh American political leaders and likewise he has sent these senior
American political leaders to foreign countries to meet with their peers he did this for quite a few years in China
uh and likewise in Russia and has done it for the last 10 years in Ukraine a
country with which he is very familiar and to which he has traveled often Herman has also uh written a good
deal and there are two of his books I would like to mention that are particularly pertain to the the topic
we're covering today one was a work in 2004 which shows the kind of pressence
that Herman exercises or possesses Reviving greater Russia the future of
Russia's borders with bellus Georgia Kazakhstan mova and
Ukraine he is also the author of post Putin succession stability and Russia's
future which is also available in Russian and Ukrainian our second guest is Steven
Brian he has also held senior Senate staff positions including for the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee and he has excelled in both the private sector and the government sector for many years he
was one of the senior civilian uh employees at the Department of Defense a
position in which he gained the highest award given by the Department of Defense
to civilians not once but twice I'm speaking of the distinguished service
metal now Dr Brian is particularly expert on technology and
strategy and as such has been contributing to other Westminster shows on China Japan Taiwan as well as on
Russia and Ukraine I should also mention that uh he
was the executive director of a Grassroots political organization uh the head of the Jewish
Institute for National Security Affairs and in the Pentagon he served as Deputy
under secretary of defense for trade security policy Dr Brian is also a frequent
contributor on foreign policy matters in his own uh column which appears usually
a couple of times weekly in which he gives his sometimes unique perspective
on the burning questions of the day including uh Russia and Ukraine so we're
delighted he is uh also back here with us to further debate the future of
Ukraine gentlemen welcome to the program
now there have been some very interesting changes of course the K Invasion by
Ukraine is one of the ones that's highlighted by many people and of course a lot of
journalists but other things have happened including very significantly
the steady advance of Russian forces on the eastern border of
Ukraine and and getting them further along to their dream of taking all of donos and L luhansk so let's start uh
Herman persner with you since you I I neglected to mention how many times
you've been to Ukraine and before that of course you were in Russia very frequently and you've brought Ukrainian
delegations to the United States uh you were there recently and I
know you're very well informed on the situation let's have your perspective on
this issue and ask you if you've been able to maintain any optimism in terms of a
favorable outcome for Ukraine thanks Bob it's a pleasure to be back with you and
Central Strategic Question
I look forward to hearing Steve's views and how they may or may not have evolved given circumstances um the the central
strategic uh question to my mind is this if Russia is permitted to use nuclear
blackmail to use the repeated use of war crimes to take land from a peaceful
country then it's only a matter of time before that lesson is repeated not just by Russia when gain strength enough to
attack again but also by China Iran and others I mean it's no um big secret why
uh South Korea Japan and Taiwan favor a uh Russian defeat because if Russia seen
to succeed with this nuclear blackmail and other tactics it strengthens the Hawks in Beijing and you can say the
same about uh Tran um you know Russia has a history of uh imperialism that
dates back a long time between 1450 and 1900 uh Russia gained an average of 50
square miles per day added it to its territory that figure was computed by
Orlando fig figgies uh and there's you can see a detailed description of that
uh and they did it by attacking when they were strong and attacking again so we see this repeated somehow in the
current erir with 2008 into Georgia 2014 in Ukraine 2022 in Ukraine and if you
want to go back a little bit you can talk about the repeated invasions of Poland 1772 1793
1795 1920 19 38 and so forth so um when
you talk about helping um Ukraine you're also talking about uh U helping others
that may be threatened it's not an accident that Sweden and Finland have chosen to join NATO because they had to
take Russian claims on their territory seriously uh it's not an accident that
uh the Baltic states in Poland wanted to be part of NATO because they had no way to defend themselves without help and
those claims go further Russia's great claims for against instance against Denmark I think something like 80,000
square miles of Arctic Ocean um but of course having Ambitions and being able
to carry them out are very different things and we're seeing this uh in Ukraine to come to the the current times
when Russia first invaded in 22 uh everybody thought three days they take
care of they did not and then there was an ambition to take uh maybe just uh nov
Ria which is the southern part of Russia maybe going to adessa maybe uh connecting with transnistria and malova
that did not work and then there's ambition to take all donbas and L H that
hasn't happened now uh the most recent pronouncement by Putin is that by
October one uh they'll be able to take a city in donbas uh uh of about 30,000 people pro
pro uh pre-war population in fact in the last day or two things have bogged down
for Russia on the Eastern front and I see no uh gains in the last 24 hours by
Russia along the that front and the number of attacks down dramatically uh
in fact since January 1 the total number of of square kilometers taken by Ukraine
primarily in dbas though not in entirely because R uh Ukraine's made modest gains
on the Eastern front but uh they've taken roughly the same amount of territory that Russia has taken from
Ukraine during that period in other words there's a net um close to zero in terms of total land
conquered now does this suggest stalemate I think stalemate may be too
broad a term I would say it suggest a military stalemate but a military
stalemate does not not mean a defeat for Ukraine or victory for Russia you
remember that the US wasn't known for losing battles in Vietnam but we lost
the war we pulled out for domestic reasons for the same reason China did several times for the same reason the
Soviet Union pulled out of Afghanistan and I think the evidence of problems building up up inside of Russia uh
evidence that the elite in Russia are starting to see that the um interests of
Russia are not the same interests of Putin um have to give rise to the
possibility that Putin may not survive and that Russia May finally have to
withdraw now that's certainly not a given we don't know how the military question will uh play out but I think uh
it's important to think about the weaknesses that uh Russia has exhibited
and that's not discussed so much um or or in instance um you have remember a
year ago in prosen the commander of Wagner took a a march on Moscow no
military units Rose to uh stop his March they sat on their toughs and he did this
not criticizing Putin but in the last weeks the commander of Paladin another
mercenary force of Russia that operates in Congo and other places in the world has issued a a
stinging denunciation of Putin uh talking about all the failures of the war and blaming it on the great Russian
leader Putin um now why does a man that has great connections to the Russian
army has great connections to Russian intelligence services and knowing the
example of prosen suddenly choose this moment to publicly uh denounce Putin and
on Telegraph and other things this has been broadcast over russan and it's probably because he's sensing some
support for this position within the military some support for this position within the intelligence Services maybe
he's looking at the damage being done to the Russian economy we know three four
days ago Russia stopped publishing figures of export of petroleum products
because their production is down and that's danger it may be because he's looking at reports and uh uh the study
of social media inside of Russia to indicate growing uh opposition to the
war anyway there are many other reasons that Russia is having internal problems
including the inability to uh produce certain W weapons are being known as a
440 country because of their primitive nature bottom line if we it's not a
given that uh if we support Ukraine with arms they win but it's the best course
of action and they have a path to Victory thank you Herman
Steve well we have a different perspective than than Herman's and different news Services I think
Ukraine Losing the War
too my assessment is quite radically different from Herman's uh I think
Ukraine is losing the war let's start there uh I think it's its Army is
getting beat up very badly especially in southern donet now uh the Russians are
adding square kilometers every day to the to their takings in that area uh PUK
which is the emerging big battle has not concluded yet by any means but it's
certainly being surrounded by the Russians and I think that's their next Target so operationally I think they're
they're they're doing very well K is a separate matter I think I think it's a
foolish move by the Ukrainian uh by zalinsky actually because I think it's
what he's promoting it U because it has drawn off some of their better forces from being able to defend key areas uh
in donet which is more wax strategically important uh so most of the evidence and
it's not all conclusive by any means and we lack a lot of information but most of the evidence shows that the the
Ukrainian military is starting to be ground down uh I think they've been tenacious they've fought very hard uh
for sure uh but there's there's simply a limit to how long they can go on and uh
you know it's very hard to tell where the breaking point is I I think I understand the the short-term Russian
strategy I don't don't pretend to understand the long-term but the short term is to try and and create a cauldron
they call it a cauldron or pincer around the main units of the Ukrainian Army and
trap them U and that's why places like pcrk and chfar and other locations which
aren't over with by any means yet but which are indicative I think of what the
Russian strategy uh militarily is um now that doesn't have necessarily translate
to what their strategic objectives are in Ukraine and and that's very I think
Herman quite right that that's that's a major issue uh and I don't think there's good answers to that because we don't
know yet um if I were betting and I don't like to bet because I usually lose
uh but if I were if I were betting I think that what the Russians are going to want is a change of Ukrainian
government for sure that's more favorable to Russia uh and the removal
of NATO forces uh and NATO influence uh in Ukraine I think that's their their
key objective and I think it has been all along U we can go back and review
History of the War
the whole history of the war it I think it was a very unprepared
Russian military that invaded they didn't expect to actually have to do it I think they were caught by surprise
they weren't prepared and they were under very bad leadership but a lot of that has changed over time as they
reshuffled their leadership they have improved their tactics and their operations uh
and now that's showing very vividly in the actual conduct of of the war the
bigger question I suppose are two one is what
will happen with Ukraine and and how soon will it happen and there are
different estimates on that I don't think it's going to last too much longer frankly because I don't think the
ukrainians can sustain it too much longer in terms of casualties in terms of their fighting ability uh and a
morale which is starting to crack in some places and and and the what follows
from that the other question the bigger one which is how does that how does that impact Europe how does it impact NATO
how does it impact American strategy I mean one of the features of this war
that isn't often talked about enough is that we have plowed in an awful lot of
equipment into the war the Ukraine war mainly in fact almost exclusively
tactical military equipment leaving ourselves with some big absences in terms of inventory of
Equipment
weapons and capabilities that we might need in Pacific and other place and the Middle East for that matter so that arm
sales for Taiwan have been held up arm sales for Israel had been held up uh not
only because of politics some of it was politics in the case of Israel but some of was just didn't have it they don't
have the supplies 155 millimeter ammo is a great example just don't have any um
and what we had we shipped to Ukraine so that leaves our forces uh in a in a kind of quandry if another War would break
out elsewhere and of course I worry about China a great deal because I think they're a growing threat in the Pacific
and from a strategic point of view it's far more important than Ukraine uh in my
estimate oh I think Ukraine was a mistake from the GetGo we should have found some way to to work a deal when we
could have but that's water over the dam of course uh whether we could have or
couldn't have is academic now the ukrainians didn't want to Washington didn't want to Nato didn't want to the
Russians didn't want to nobody wanted to and and so you end up in a war um I I'm
not sure about Herman's terminology nuclear blackmail Russia is certainly a nuclear power but so is China and pretty
soon Iran will be so I know is that nuclear blackmail I I think the we so
far thank God it's been a conventional fight with conventional largely
Conventional Weapons on both sides and there have been some very interesting developments of of how new types of
weapons like drones are playing in increasingly important role in combat uh
which we are now learning and I think we learn a lot but the Russians are also learning a lot because we're pushing
some of our best weapons High Mars is just one example attacks is another
example into the fight and they're learning how to counter them so it's it's also in helping them uh understand
how to deal with us there's no doubt and I want to make it very clear and I think Herman and I would agree on this there's
no doubt there's a really significant competition between Russia on the one side and its block of not very Savory
bunch of characters and and the Western world that fight is absolutely on the
question is of Ukraine is not about in my opinion is is yes you can try to hold
Ukraine but you're going to pay a high cost you're going to deplete your arsenals and you may lose that's my
opinion so stop there and we can go on from there let me ask you
Cabinet Changes
both about the significance of the cabinet changes in both Ukraine and
Russia sininsky has made a pretty clean sweep uh Putin seems to be more
selective in the moves he's the changes he's made in the cabinet one of the most interesting of which is to remove a
military figure as minister of defense and install an
accountant well he's not yeah you're talking he's not really a military figure he was he's he wears a military
Corruption
uniform but he's not a combat he's not a combat guy so I mean that but I think
the problem in Russia which is an endemic problem in Russia across the board is
corruption and the problem in the military was delivering Goods to the soldiers even down to simple things like
rations that were substandard poor uh
where they were charging High fees you know it's a racket the the Putin didn't like it uh not that he has much room to
talk about it but he didn't like it the troops didn't like it some of the
commanders hated it and so they're cleaning house they've made a number of arrests of senior military figures U who
have you know theyve none of them gone to jail yet but they've been arrested and it's all about corruption
so that's the Herman can talk about the Ukrainian but that's what I know about the Russian side
yeah you know there's so much corruption in Russia if you want to charge somebody in corruption just figure out who your
enemy is and go after him everybody's guilty and you have the same thing in China and other places uh one point I
want to respond to is when I was in Ukraine in January you hear the same
story over and over again many more of us going to die but we don't want to surrender the lives of our children and
grandchildren to Moscow rule if you're looking at the polling More than 70% of
the Ukrainian population is not willing to give up land for peace they're going to continue uh to fight and uh there's a
lot of comment about the Manpower but you know they had an electric sign up for drafting over 2 million ukrainians
signed up the problem is at least as much in terms of uh training capability
and equip where are those two million people Perman they don't have two million people signed up
that where'd you get that number it's it's a public figure no it's not there's
no happy to they have not recruited two million people into the army not
yesterday no no they signed up to to register they're not into the
army all right they be called up no they're not in the Army fair enough yeah
so um so I think you're going to have Ukraine continuing to fight and I don't
think the will to fight is going to stay there with Russia which is why I'm more optimistic than uh than Steve is about
the the outcome of the war now the changing of uh Personnel um in part I
think is burnout I think it's in part consolidation of Power by sininsky who
has uh internal politics to worry about uh do I think it'll affect the outcome
of the war I think not too much I agree with that I don't think it has any impact at all
I think but the sininsky is not the first shakeup he's done this like the third yeah yeah he does it all the time
but it seems the biggest one is kuuba who's the foreign minister who's apparently was fired but the ver Rada
the legislature there has not approved his firing so there may be a political
struggle here that we're not so aware of so zinsky has named his deputy as
foreign minister and I agree with Steve it's not clear how that'll play out but
I as has been done with other uh people there'll be another job for them in the
Russia
administration are you at all surprised that these significant changes have been made including in Russia uh in the
middle of a war at a particularly intense time that's usually not looked upon as a
good time to make changes of this importance well that's not exactly right because we changed commanders in Wartime
Changing commanders
in many wars we certainly did it in World War II or shivil war Civil War for
sure I mean it happens uh you generally weed out the the bad eggs and go with
the ones that are effective um in Russia I think it's what's happened is that
they want to jack up their whole military-industrial complex let's call it that it's Eisenhower's famous
terminology and they want higher production of weapons and new weapons uh and there was
a great concern that they weren't getting there um because of the
corruption and the the lack of modern what can we call management U and that's why you put a
new defense minister in who that's a specialty he's not a defense guy he's a
he's an industrial economic guy there also a struggle going on
between the intelligence services and the military which is why you have a disproportionate intelligence presence
in K as opposed to clear military command there so internal battles inside
of Russia I don't know if it's a battle or whether that's how they do things when when have those two
organizations gotten along ever well in any country try it out try out any others you like uh you know it it goes I
How much force
mean I don't think that's very significant I think the significant question uh for the Russians right now
is uh how much force they want to bring to bear in these in this war they've
been it seems to me they've been fairly consistant and not jacking up the number
of troops too high uh they have a huge Reserve um and they're following a a
steady program you don't have to agree with it but it's a steady program of trying to take more of the donbass
and to trap the Ukrainian Army which is what their goal they have but they haven't simply have not taken very much
territory since January one of this year it's uh roughly
equal to the number of square kilometers Ukraine has taken in kers but nothing up
there on a 650 mile front many how many spaces have Russians
taken more than a couple kilometers no not many there only a couple places tens of kilometers and in CR critical towns I
mean come on let's be 10 kilometers is six miles and with the number of losses
the Brits think the Russians have been losing more than a thousand a day over a period of
months who's losing a thousand a day that's a British number British number yeah yeah I don't believe it I don't
know what it is by the way and I don't know what it is either but it's there are no reliable numbers in this war from
either side and I wouldn't believe a single single one of them because they're all fake I mean the question is
are the ukrainians able to hold these strongholds which they built consider uh
P psk which is a stronghold town I mean it's highly fortified and can they you
know like Adco was like bmot was and can they hold well those two they didn't
hold and it looks like they're going to lose PK over time how soon it's possible
there have been no gains in the last three days and the defenses on the edge of the town are are substantial we'll
see I agree I don't know how it would turn out in other Villages but I think the important thing here is is that the
the ukrainians are on their backs in these places and they're having difficulty serious difficult they're saying so they're they're open about
that they're not lying is it more significant than territory lost in KK KK
is nothing I mean it's an empty area it's mostly small a big shock wave
Moscow and destabilizing to the Putin regime it's not destabilizing anything
where do you see that your evidence there's no evidence of any destabilization I think they're
China
annoyed I think they're Chinese they're pissed off that uh they weren't prepared
for that move and they were got caught with their pants down no doubt about
that um otherwise they would have had it fortified and they would have blocked it right away but but it's not it's not
strategic territory because it doesn't mean anything you can't go anywhere from there has to no it has to do with
internal Russian politics and I don't think it does I mean that's where we would differ
Putin
because I don't see any evidence that there's any fall off in Putin's uh
leadership there at all uh I know there's a wishful thinking on the western part that somehow we can
overturn the Russian the Putin get rid of Putin and everything will be okay well we can't get rid of Putin going to
get rid of Putin Russians and after all this is how people go out we did a study
of 120 postor War II dictatorships of 10 million people or more what happens to
them 42% by cou 20% by assassination Bad Business you don't
want to be a dictator there's some exceptions to the rule of of Castro made
it to the end and Franco I mean you go analyst you can find examples of both
yeah but think about the big case against Putin if he he says I'm scared of NATO is NATO bigger now or smaller is
it more unified or less unified is it better funded or less funded what about the Strategic uh uh advantage in oil and
petroleum s sales in Europe that's gone what about the political influence that comes from that is that gone what about
the intellectual uh Flight of the best and brightest Young technical people
they have left Russia not to come back what about the degreg of the Russian army that may even have trouble with at
some point with h uh Civil Wars and the northern caucuses the CHS and so forth
you can go on and on about Putin's misjudgments and I think it's it doesn't take a lot of imagination to understand
that some people are not happy and ambitious people who are looking for opportunities the man is is not all
powerful and going back to uh Gregor's zaky's U uh condemnation of Putin um
there's the reason for that it's a serious guy making condemnations and others are doing too look at former
Kremlin Chief of Staff uh U yeni Sebastiano saying no Russian leader is
affected uh has uh caused more damage to Russian interest in Putin those
denunciations I don't have any brief for Putin all I'm saying is if you base America Amer policy on the myth that
Myth
somehow Russia's going to turn over its leadership you're making a big mistake it's a bad strategy if it happens great
but it's not going to happen in my opinion anytime soon but if it happens it happens but to try and base your
National strategy on something as cical as that seems to me foolish I you want
to do I don't think you B your strategy on it but I think you monitor it and
certainly you base strategy on not letting Uh Russian aggression using war
crimes and nuclear blackmail which they do do um that's where you started but
National Strategy
that I I don't necessarily disagree with any of that that's not my point you're not listening to listen to what I'm
saying if you base your National strategy that somehow Russia is going to turn over its leadership and become
peaceful and and happy you're dreaming no they won't I mean I wrote a whole
book about this get a national leader that's 10 times worse than Putin with rattling his
nuclear weapons you know or using those goddamn things so let's let's I think this is a crazy kind of thinking that's
going on in the west right now it's not it's in it's all over the place that somehow you know that we just have to
hang on until Putin disappears well at some point well he
will eventually at some point the Soviets quit Afghanistan at some point the United States kept to Vietnam and
what's the alternative alternative is to let Putin grab territory rest and then
grab more Terr and more territory you can't permit that my friend ad of Dos in Afghanistan
Afghanistan
never forgot it he he was a very good friend I didn't like what they did there it was
horrible they're good at horrible okay that's not what you base your policy
on if you Chinese are good at horrible too I mean you don't base your policy on
that you base your policy on how to deal with the threat in a practical way and
if you squander all your resources in this adventure in Ukraine such that you
weaken our defenses elsewhere and you risk even Europe it's a crazy way to go
about it that's my opinion now not everybody shares it I know that the countries most threatened by China South
Korea Japan Taiwan are rooting for Russia to be defeated they're rooting for the roting
Taiwan
for the United States actually I'm sure they because they depend on the United States for their
security Japan is a small tiny Army it's not able to fight at all um Taiwan is a
poor island with 28 million people against a billion Chinese you know the
numbers are very demonstrative uh these are countries that are hoping that we'll
make the difference for their survival so if we risk that because we
don't have high Mars we gave them all the Ukraine or we don't want have 155 millimeter ammo or or we don't have tow
missiles or you name it go on down the list javelins um then they're left naked
and alone so no one has considered that carefully because we haven't been able
to you know what we've discovered in this country is that trying to strengthen our defense industry and get
more productivity hasn't really worked out hasn't G familiar with takes too
long to produce these weapons in in any quantity and then we give them to Ukraine anyway so it you know you have
to kind of balance things here somehow or we're going to we're going to get taken to the cleaners that's my
gentlemen if I can I'm familiar with says we run out of weapons in a fight
with China over Taiwan within a couple weeks so we have the shortage and that's
an enormous problem but their weapons that were uh certain numbers of attacks
that were decommissioning that could go to Ukraine without any difficulty if there was Will well if I could just uh
Negotiations
direct a discussion to this area both uh Putin and
zalinski uh have both talked about negotiations of course they have
different terms for those negotiations to begin Etc but the very fact that they're talking about
negotiations may be significant or not uh I would like your opinion on that and
also do you think the war there has reached the point where what they're
doing now is jockeying for a better position uh to be in a better position
at the beginning of those negotiations zinsky has said outright that the kers
incursion is to have a chit in those negotiations that he wouldn't have unless they had successfully undertaken
that Invasion and of course we know that as as Steve Brian has mentioned
Russia uh is is able to keep up the pressure over several hundred mile front
uh which Ukraine cannot possibly meet in all those locations because of the size
of its military and the fact that they have sent a significant part of it into
k i so are we at that kind of Tipping Point that they're saying okay let's we need we both sides
we need to wrap this up because otherwise there doesn't seem to be any
conclusion in the near future that's going to uh end up any different way
than it would now if we began peace negotiations Steve do you want to take a
shot at that I'll take a stab at it but it's it's a Modi was just in KF
Peace initiative
uh week ago or two weeks ago I'm not sure which it was trying to promote uh
some kind of Peace initiative um and didn't get anywhere
zero I think that's just right it's politically not possible for any Ukrainian government to trade uh land
for peace at this point well then there's no negotiation right that's right so there will be no negotiation
and I think the Russians now feel the same way yeah right now there's zero
Ukraines political reality
prospects well Herman let me ask you at a certain point after taking a terrible
beating uh it from what I've been reading there are more and more ukrainians who are facing the political
reality of their military situation and more of them understand it's not a matter of our surrendering
Ukrainian territory the Russians have already captured that territory and we
have no prospects of of pushing them out of dbas and Lans much less Crimea so
reality intrudes in Wars at a at a point at which people realize unless they want
even bigger losses they they're going to have to come up with something the
fundamental political reality in Ukraine is that repeated foreign polls show 70
some per of the Ukrainian population does not want to trade land for peace are they in favor of negotiations they
in favor of Peace yes do they want to give up land for no well how are they
going to get the land back I mean that's it it doesn't matter how they feel it's what they can do I think I'll tell you
what they think it may be right or wrong they think if they continue to get enough arms to fight they it last Russia
and time is on their side actually I think they think
NATO intervention
differently I I think the game is to try and get NATO to intervene and that what the reason they
want to do deep strikes with missiles in Russia which won't change the war is designed to to get the Russians mad
enough uh to do something stupid and draw in NATO and create a EUR Europe
Wide War because they think that's the only way they're going to be saved that's what I think the game is I
don't don't like that game I don't think it's a good game I don't think NATO will go to war in Ukraine at least I hope not
but because it won't be just in Ukraine it'll be in Europe so if we won World
War III that's one way to get there I would say Steve that Putin seem to be
War with NATO
well aware of the danger of a war with NATO and and has not expressed any
willingness to push in that direction oh no he's pushed the other way around I
mean he keep saying we don't have any fight with Europe of course the Europeans have a different view but but
but that's uh that's Putin but I I think that the problem is we we're in a a
black period now because there's no negotiation there's no chance of any at
least that's so how it looks now and the wars continuing and the Russians as I
said before I believe are gaining well it it doesn't seem under any circumstances that Russia would give
up they have the resources to continue they have the Manpower to continue and
those are two things that are very much in doubt in Ukraine because they're getting their resources from Western
countries uh and Western countries have less and less to give they have less to
give and and at a greater cost to themselves trying but I think that you know the the amount of equipment that's
been handed over and the amount that's been lost is just pretty staggering well you have mentioned a lot
of equipment loss on the Russian side that can't be yeah but they have more no they they don't have
more they're running out of artillery so uh but Steve was uh correct that you
can't count on uh a change of U government in Russia but on the other
hand you can't count on no change either you have to be a ready for any option
Protecting American interests
yeah I just think the point my point was not that you can't can't or can or can't
my point was that if you can't put your policy based on that your interests are your interests
if the Russian government changes maybe it's for the good and maybe it's even worse I mean there's you just can't bet
on that uh you what you do is you want to say is is my strategy is my national
strategy the right one to protect American interests talking about American interests yeah right we want to
protect America's interests we want to make sure America remains strong we want to make sure we can deal with threats
elsewhere in the world especially China U these are critical issues and you keep
funneling stuff to Ukraine with not even a single look at where you stand in terms of your capabilities and what
remains is crazy and I think I think all your goals and Reckless I think all your girls are
correct but I think your answer is wrong I think we protect all those goals by
helping Ukraine defeat Russia good luck well we'll find out we'll find out time
NATO
speaking of NATO gentlemen and U Europe has their view of a Russian
threat um increased or diminished according to the status of the war now as you know
after the Russian invasion NATO and other European powers were suff efficiently
alarmed that there were three new NATO members and uh even Germany was talking
about increasing its defense budget to meet the but their Chancellor told them no because they have no money yeah well
that's the problem yeah did did have any of them met those obligations has their sense of
alarm uh diminished to the point where they have now said well we we yeah we
can't afford this military build up our countries are dipping into recession and
uh therefore we're not going to undertake it we'll just rely on the United States to come to our rescue as
has been the case over uh recent decades when they a lot of that I mean it's a welfare
operation um and some of them have built up a bit Poes I think have done a good
job uh in that respect the Germans have not the British are in terrible trouble
economically and their military is shrinking U they can't afford to keep
what they've got which is very the size of the British army now is smaller than it was at this time of the American
Revolution it's really pretty bad uh the French have a modestly sized military
but but it's mostly territorial U very little projection capability uh the
bottom line is that without the United States NATO is pretty much
finished so it has to absolutely rely on the United States that's that's the reality I think every analyst would
agree with that just count noses I mean there are 970 million roughly 970
million I may be off a few million people in Europe that are members of
NATO that's a lot of people that's a lot of economic power but it doesn't show up
in their military uh and strategic plan at all I mean it just isn't there I mean
what Trump complained about 2% is just Child's Play compared to the bigger problem which is the lack of a real uh
defense capability in Western e well in eastern and western Europe for that matter uh with the exception of Poland
which I think has done some improvement well I think you find a direct correlation between countries like
Poland and the bals are closer you are to Russia the more likely you are to raise your defense budget because you
feel the threat more acutely and plus you're hungry and then you don't at all well that's the case all by itself
but I think you find something interesting about the German defense companies are beginning to make plans
and actually beginning to build defense Manufacturing in Western Ukraine now they can do it quicker because they
don't have the environmental restrictions on building and they have a a Workforce so nice targets for the
Russians in Western Ukraine does you really think oh they already hitting Lviv quite regularly now Lviv is pretty
West it's almost well it's it's absolutely West but it's uh can you not
protect factories maybe well you couldn't protect the 179th Training
Center uh in Ukraine which Russians just hit with a scander I mean it's very difficult
Herman I mean you know yeah but we also don't give them their def ask taret painted on it we don't give them their
defense they're asking for if I were if I were the Germans I would get paid up front for those
factories they're investing their own money as are the Turks and they're nuts yeah because they're going to lose their
they're going to lose their shirts well obviously they have a different point of view or would I mean you know if you
want to bet your bet bet but uh it seems to me why don't they invest in German
manufacturing true because the German government won't buy
Europe
it well gentlemen overall would you say after what we two and a half years into
this war are the Europeans uh as worried
about Russia less worried because they've seen perhaps some diminished capabilities and the limits of Russian
military power they're more worried I think I agree with Herman on that
because worried and they're also worried about what might happen in the United States
so they're gonna join Putin in voting for
Harris well he endorsed her today so I can't top that
Economy
one they're taking a close look at their economies that is in Ukraine and Russia uh with the expectation that this
war is not going to be over tomorrow and uh one thing that certainly
has gotten Putin's attention is the the fall in the ruble and the state of
inflation in that country which You' think would have to impact on
the war effort if at a certain point if that gets serious enough and of course Ukraine has its own
economic problems since it's surviving on the largest of other nations yeah and it can't pay its debt yeah
Russia is notoriously U off when they issue any projections on
economics and they're projecting only a 1% growth next year probably means they really believe in negative growth so the
constraints on uh Russian economic capability are likely to continue
especially if more uh oil production facilities and terminals are taken
not we'll see about that I don't know I mean I'm not an economist I'm not going to bet on the Russian economy in any
US Policy
case it's not it's not very good bet um yeah you know we've talked about the
European policy what by the way the Europeans are not in such great shape either when it comes to
economics right and and we may not be soon enough
uh we are not I mean look at the debt yes are the staggering debt and uh
tipping into recession um but what do you think today should be the uh US policy toward this
conflict Herman we should give the ukrainians what they're asking for and not have restrictions on attack amuse
inside of Russia and you don't see any danger of flipping this up to another level of conflict if Russia the danger
of not helping Ukraine is greater than the danger of helping them all right right Steve I completely disagree I
think that the idea of attacking inside Russia with long range missiles is bound to escalate the war and the Russians
will take seriously dangerous steps we don't want to encourage that I think that would there's no point in it anyway
because it has no military value the bottom line here is that if we keep
pushing the ukrainians they're just going to have higher casualties lose more people those war is going to become
more awful and it's got no good outcome for our from our point of view or anybody else's point of view including
the ukrainians themselves and I you know I know you cited some polls I don't know
about these polls uh but I don't care what the polls say if if they want to go
and die they'll go and die but I think the bottom line here is that this is a very bad War it's going south very
quickly and I think it would be very important for if the US really wanted to pursue a policy it would try to find
some way to open the door to talk to Moscow overall because we have no relationship at all with the Russians
right now I think that's a a mistake we're not physically at war with Russia
there's still room for diplomacy we and I'm not a diplomat but I think diplomacy here would be helpful Steve wouldn't you
say according to some American foreign policy mavens that the interest of the
us being served here is the weakening of Russia if they are being weakened I mean
that's a that's an interesting question which I I don't think we know the answer to I mean they're strengthening their
military they're in adding new conventional and unconventional weapons
to their Arsenal they've ginned up their their industrial complex to produce more
and more weapons are we weakening them not sure the sanctions didn't have
their impact they were supposed to knock them out didn't work it backfired to a certain extent we have certainly
divorced for Russia from the West that's been a success if that was our intention but that also shuts down an Avenue for
the future and push the Russians into the arms of the Chinese is that good policy I don't think so so I think
overall it's not been very brilliant I don't know where to start the Russian economy is weakened and uh
by their own statistics and projections is going downhill cooperation with China is uh
serious along with Iran but uh you're not going to separate Russia from China
that's an illusion there's no way to to do that when you travel along the Russia
China border the Russian officials get more of their money out of Chinese bribes and they get from their own
salary they have U Russia essentially has become almost a
colony of China and that's not likely to change so uh well gentlemen I'm afraid
we're out of time now and I would like to thank our two guests U Herman persner
