The Tea Act of 1773 led to the Boston Tea Party. Colonists, motivated by taxation without representation, organized resistance. Samuel Adams coordinated the Sons of Liberty who dumped tea into Boston Harbor. This event caused King George III to pass the Intolerable Acts, which closed Boston Harbor. The escalating conflict eventually led to the American Revolution. Evidence from parliamentary records confirms that the Tea Act was designed to assert British authority. The Boston Tea Party demonstrates colonial willingness to resist British policies through direct action. Alternative explanations suggest that economic self-interest rather than constitutional principles motivated colonial resistance. However, evidence from working-class participation refutes this economic self-interest theory.
