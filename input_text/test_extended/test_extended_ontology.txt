The Boston Tea Party occurred on December 16, 1773, when American colonists dumped British tea into Boston Harbor. 
This event was a direct response to the Tea Act passed by Parliament earlier that year, which gave the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the colonies.
Contemporary accounts describe how colonists, disguised as Mohawk Indians, boarded ships and threw 342 chests of tea overboard.
John Adams later wrote that "The People should never rise, without doing something to be rememberedâ€”something notable And striking."
This event demonstrated that colonists were willing to take direct action against British policies they considered unjust.
The British response was swift and harsh, leading to the Coercive Acts of 1774, which further united colonial opposition.
