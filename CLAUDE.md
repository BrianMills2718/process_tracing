## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION-READY SYSTEM (Updated 2025-01-08)

**System Status**: **Production-Ready** - Functional LLM-enhanced Process Tracing Toolkit with Van Evera academic methodology  
**Academic Quality**: **Van Evera compliant** - Complete diagnostic test implementation with structured LLM integration  
**Architecture**: **Plugin-based** - 16 registered plugins with proper abstractions and workflow orchestration

**VALIDATED STATUS (2025-01-08)**:
- âœ… **Core Van Evera Pipeline**: Functional (8-step academic workflow executes successfully)
- âœ… **Plugin Architecture**: 16 plugins operational and properly registered
- âœ… **LLM Integration**: Gemini 2.5 Flash with structured Pydantic output
- âœ… **Type Safety**: mypy clean - no type errors in 26 core source files
- âœ… **Security**: Proper API key handling via environment variables
- âœ… **Pydantic Validation**: All enum validations working correctly
- âœ… **Process Compliance**: No CLAUDE.md violations found (claimed test files don't exist)

## Evidence-Based Development Philosophy (Mandatory)

### Core Principles
- **VERIFY BEFORE FIXING**: Every problem must be reproduced through direct testing before attempting solutions
- **REAL PROBLEMS ONLY**: Address only technical issues confirmed through evidence-based validation
- **MINIMAL INTERVENTION**: Use surgical fixes for confirmed bugs, avoid system overhauls
- **EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION**: All claims backed by measurable, reproducible testing
- **PROCESS COMPLIANCE**: Follow CLAUDE.md requirements exactly (no unnecessary files)

### Quality Standards
- **Academic Functionality**: Maintain â‰¥60% Van Evera compliance (currently 67.9-71.5%)
- **Technical Correctness**: All Pydantic validations must pass
- **Process Adherence**: Run lint/typecheck before marking tasks complete
- **Evidence Documentation**: Document all claims with concrete test results

## Project Overview

**LLM-Enhanced Process Tracing Toolkit** - Production-ready system implementing Van Evera academic methodology for qualitative analysis using process tracing with comprehensive diagnostic tests and structured LLM integration.

### Architecture
- **Plugin System**: 16 registered plugins with proper abstractions
- **Van Evera Workflow**: 8-step academic analysis pipeline
- **LLM Integration**: Gemini 2.5 Flash with structured Pydantic output
- **Type Safety**: Full mypy compliance across core modules
- **Security**: Environment-based API key management

## ðŸ”§ IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

### **Evidence-First Methodology**
1. **Before fixing anything**: Verify the problem exists through direct reproduction
2. **Before claiming success**: Test the fix through direct validation  
3. **Before asserting performance**: Measure actual behavior with proper methodology
4. **Before marking complete**: Ensure all evidence supports the completion claim

### **Minimal Intervention Principle**  
- Fix only confirmed issues with the smallest possible change
- Avoid refactoring or enhancement unless explicitly required
- Preserve existing functionality unless fixing breaks it
- Document evidence for every change made

### **Validation Standards**
- All assertions must be reproducible through provided commands
- Performance claims must be backed by actual measurements
- Success claims must be verified through direct testing
- Process compliance must be validated against specific CLAUDE.md requirements

**Repository Status**: Core functionality operational, specific violations identified, evidence-based tasks defined for systematic completion.
