  Real Process Tracing Cross-Case Methods:
  - Most Different Systems Design: Compare cases with different contexts but same outcome
  - Most Similar Systems Design: Compare similar cases with different outcomes
  - Within-Case vs Cross-Case: Process tracing is primarily within-case, but can be strengthened by cross-case comparison

  2. Comparison would be at the mechanism/hypothesis level, not network topology
  3. This is advanced methodology - not essential for your current system
