# PHASE 10: THEORY-BUILDING PROCESS TRACING (LOWER JUICE/SQUEEZE)

**Priority**: 7 - Medium Impact
**Complexity**: High
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks
**Juice/Squeeze Ratio**: 5/10 - Important for theory development but high complexity

## Overview

Implement theory-building process tracing capabilities to systematically construct new theories from empirical patterns, abstract mechanisms across cases, and generate testable hypotheses. This transforms our toolkit from theory-testing to theory-generating methodology.

## Core Problem

Current system tests existing theories but doesn't systematically build new ones. Theory-building process tracing enables:
- **Pattern Abstraction**: Extract generalizable patterns from specific cases
- **Mechanism Generalization**: Develop abstract causal mechanisms
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Create testable propositions from empirical findings
- **Theory Construction**: Build coherent theoretical frameworks

### LLM Theory-Building Prompt
```
Build theory from the following empirical patterns:

1. PATTERN ABSTRACTION:
   - What are the common elements across these patterns?
   - What can be abstracted to higher levels of generality?
   - Which components are invariant vs variable?

2. MECHANISM GENERALIZATION:
   - What are the abstract causal mechanisms at work?
   - How can specific mechanisms be generalized?
   - What functional categories emerge?

3. HYPOTHESIS GENERATION:
   - What testable propositions follow from these patterns?
   - What are the key causal claims?
   - What scope conditions apply?

4. THEORY CONSTRUCTION:
   - How do mechanisms fit together into a coherent theory?
   - What are the core theoretical propositions?
   - How does this relate to existing theories?

5. VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:
   - What evidence would support or refute this theory?
   - What crucial cases should be tested?
   - What are the theory's falsifiable implications?

Output structured theory with clear propositions and test requirements.
