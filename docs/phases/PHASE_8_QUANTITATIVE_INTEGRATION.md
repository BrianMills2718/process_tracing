   - Which quantitative variables correspond to qualitative mechanisms?
   - How can statistical measures proxy for process components?
   - What temporal alignment is needed between data and processes?

2. STATISTICAL VALIDATION:
   - Do regression results support qualitative pathway claims?
   - What statistical tests would validate mechanism presence?
   - How strong is quantitative evidence for each mechanism?

3. MIXED METHODS SYNTHESIS:
   - Where do qualitative and quantitative findings converge?
   - What discrepancies exist and how can they be resolved?
   - What additional evidence would strengthen mixed methods conclusions?

4. ROBUSTNESS ASSESSMENT:
   - How robust are qualitative findings to quantitative evidence?
   - What statistical assumptions are critical for validation?
