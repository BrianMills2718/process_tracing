# PHASE 5: COMPARATIVE PROCESS TRACING (HIGH JUICE/SQUEEZE)

**Priority**: 2 - High Impact  
**Complexity**: Medium-High
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Juice/Squeeze Ratio**: 8/10 - Essential for generalization with moderate complexity

## Overview

Implement comparative process tracing capabilities to analyze multiple cases, identify recurring mechanisms, and support systematic comparison using Most Similar Systems (MSS) and Most Different Systems (MDS) designs. This transforms our single-case toolkit into a comparative methodology.

## Core Problem

Current system analyzes individual cases in isolation. Comparative process tracing enables:

   - Identify structurally similar causal pathways
   - Note variations in mechanism implementation
   - Assess functional equivalence across contexts

2. SCOPE CONDITIONS:
   - When do these mechanisms work vs fail?
   - What contextual factors enable/disable mechanisms?
   - Boundary conditions for mechanism operation

3. EVIDENCE PATTERNS:
   - How does evidence strength vary across cases?
   - Which evidence types are most consistent?
   - Cross-case evidence triangulation

4. GENERALIZATION POTENTIAL:
   - Which patterns are case-specific vs generalizable?
   - Confidence in cross-case mechanism validity
   - Recommendations for scope condition testing

Output structured comparative analysis with confidence scores.
