# PHASE 4: TEMPORAL PROCESS TRACING (HIGH JUICE/SQUEEZE)

**Priority**: 1 - Highest Impact
**Complexity**: Medium  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Juice/Squeeze Ratio**: 9/10 - Fundamental capability gap with moderate implementation complexity

## Overview

Implement temporal process tracing capabilities to handle time-ordered causal sequences, critical junctures, and process duration analysis. This addresses a fundamental limitation where current system can't validate temporal ordering or analyze timing of causal processes.

## Core Problem

Modern process tracing requires temporal validation - understanding WHEN events occurred and in what ORDER. Our current system extracts causal relationships but ignores temporal sequence, which can lead to post-hoc fallacies and invalid causal inference.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 4A: Temporal Extraction & Validation (Week 1-2)
**Target**: Extract and validate temporal sequences from text

#### Task 1: Temporal Entity Extraction
**Files**: `core/temporal_extraction.py` (new)
- Extract temporal expressions from text (dates, times, sequences)
- Use LLM structured output to identify temporal relationships
- Parse relative temporal expressions ("after", "before", "during", "while")
- Handle temporal uncertainty and ranges

#### Task 2: Temporal Graph Extension
**Files**: `core/temporal_graph.py` (new), `core/ontology.py` (modify)
- Extend graph nodes with temporal attributes (timestamp, duration, sequence_order)
- Add temporal edge types (precedes, concurrent, overlaps, follows)
- Implement temporal constraint validation
- Add temporal sequence checking algorithms

#### Task 3: Temporal Sequence Validation
**Files**: `core/temporal_validator.py` (new)
- Validate that extracted causal chains follow temporal logic
- Flag temporal inconsistencies (effect before cause)
- Handle uncertain temporal ordering
- Generate temporal violation reports

### Phase 4B: Critical Juncture Analysis (Week 2-3)
**Target**: Identify key decision points and temporal branching

#### Task 4: Critical Juncture Detection
**Files**: `core/critical_junctures.py` (new)
- Identify key decision points in temporal sequences
- Detect temporal branching (where different paths become possible)
- Analyze timing of critical decisions
- Assess counterfactual sensitivity at junctures

#### Task 5: Process Duration Analysis
**Files**: `core/duration_analysis.py` (new)
- Calculate duration of causal processes
- Identify fast vs slow causal mechanisms
- Analyze timing sensitivity of outcomes
- Generate temporal process reports

### Phase 4C: Temporal Visualization & Integration (Week 3)
**Target**: Interactive temporal visualization and pipeline integration

#### Task 6: Timeline Visualization
**Files**: `core/temporal_viz.py` (new), modify HTML generation
- Create interactive timeline visualizations
- Timeline + network hybrid views
- Temporal sequence animation capabilities
- Critical juncture highlighting

#### Task 7: Pipeline Integration
**Files**: `core/analyze.py` (modify), `process_trace_advanced.py` (modify)
- Integrate temporal analysis into main pipeline
- Add temporal validation to quality gates
- Update HTML reporting with temporal sections
- Comprehensive temporal analysis workflow

## Technical Implementation

### Temporal Data Structures
```python
@dataclass
class TemporalNode:
    node_id: str
    timestamp: Optional[datetime]
    duration: Optional[timedelta]
    temporal_uncertainty: float
    sequence_order: Optional[int]
    temporal_type: str  # absolute, relative, uncertain

@dataclass
class TemporalEdge:
    source: str
    target: str
    temporal_relation: str  # precedes, concurrent, overlaps
    temporal_gap: Optional[timedelta]
    confidence: float
```

### LLM Temporal Extraction Prompt
```
Extract temporal information from the following text:

1. TEMPORAL ENTITIES:
   - Specific dates/times
   - Relative temporal expressions
   - Duration expressions
   - Sequence indicators

2. TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS:
   - Which events precede others
   - Concurrent events
   - Causal timing requirements

3. CRITICAL JUNCTURES:
   - Key decision points
   - Moments where alternative paths were possible
   - Timing-sensitive transitions

Output structured temporal data with confidence scores.
```
