   - What does centrality mean for causal importance?
   - How do different centrality measures reveal different aspects?

2. COMMUNITY STRUCTURE:
   - What functional communities exist in the network?
   - How do communities relate to causal mechanisms?
   - What are the key inter-community connections?

3. STRUCTURAL PATTERNS:
   - What recurring patterns (motifs) appear in the network?
   - How do structural patterns relate to causal functions?
   - What does the overall network topology suggest?

4. ROBUSTNESS ANALYSIS:
