# PHASE 6: BAYESIAN PROCESS TRACING (HIGH JUICE/SQUEEZE)

**Priority**: 3 - High Impact
**Complexity**: High
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks  
**Juice/Squeeze Ratio**: 8/10 - Modern methodological standard with significant complexity

## Overview

Implement Bayesian process tracing following Beach & Pedersen framework to provide rigorous probabilistic inference, prior probability assignment, likelihood ratio calculation, and posterior belief updating. This transforms qualitative process tracing into systematic probabilistic analysis.

## Core Problem

Current system provides binary evidence assessment (supporting/refuting) without quantifying confidence or uncertainty. Bayesian process tracing enables:
- **Probabilistic Confidence**: Quantified belief in hypotheses

    },
    'straw_in_wind': {
        'supporting': (1.1, 3.0),   # Weak-moderate support

### LLM Bayesian Analysis Prompt
```
Perform Bayesian analysis of the following process tracing evidence:

1. PRIOR PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT:
   - Based on domain knowledge and base rates
   - Consider alternative hypotheses
   - Justify prior probability ranges

2. LIKELIHOOD RATIO CALCULATION:
   - For each piece of evidence, assess:
     * P(Evidence | Hypothesis True)
     * P(Evidence | Hypothesis False)
   - Consider evidence quality and reliability
   - Account for potential confounding factors

3. POSTERIOR CALCULATION:
   - Apply Bayes' rule systematically
   - Show calculation steps
   - Provide confidence intervals

4. UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT:
   - Identify key uncertainty sources
   - Assess sensitivity to prior assumptions
   - Recommend robustness tests
