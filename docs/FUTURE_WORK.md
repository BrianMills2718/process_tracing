# Future Work - Process Tracing Toolkit

## Overview

This document outlines planned enhancements and architectural improvements for the LLM-Enhanced Process Tracing Toolkit. The system currently implements qualitative Van Evera methodology with sophisticated LLM integration. Future work focuses on methodological flexibility, analytical rigor, and configurable paradigm selection.

## Phase 2: Methodological Architecture Refactor

### Configurable Analysis Paradigms

**Current State**: System uses qualitative Van Evera methodology with some pseudo-Bayesian numerical updating  
**Target State**: Clean separation of methodological approaches with user-configurable selection

```python
class AnalysisMode(Enum):
    QUALITATIVE_VAN_EVERA = "qualitative"      # Pure elimination logic
    BAYESIAN_LLM_ESTIMATED = "bayesian"        # LLM-estimated parameters
    HYBRID_MIXED = "hybrid"                     # Combined approach
    COMPARATIVE_CASE = "comparative"            # Multi-case analysis

class ProcessTracingConfig:
    analysis_mode: AnalysisMode
    llm_parameter_estimation: bool
    confidence_scoring: bool
    elimination_logic_only: bool
    narrative_synthesis: bool
    quantitative_outputs: bool
```

### LLM-Estimated Bayesian Parameters

**Concept**: Use LLMs to estimate Bayesian parameters the way human experts would, providing theoretical justification for numerical values.

**Implementation Goals**:
- **Prior Estimation**: LLM estimates `P(hypothesis)` based on domain knowledge and context
- **Likelihood Ratios**: LLM estimates `P(evidence|hypothesis)` vs `P(evidence|¬hypothesis)` with reasoning
- **Parameter Justification**: Academic-quality explanations for all numerical estimates
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence intervals and sensitivity analysis
- **Domain Adaptation**: Context-aware parameter estimation based on field (political science, history, etc.)

**Example LLM Prompts**:
```
"As a political science expert, estimate the prior probability that ideological factors 
drove the American Revolution, considering: [context]. Provide your estimate as a 
probability with academic justification."

"Given this evidence: [evidence], estimate the likelihood ratio P(E|H₁)/P(E|H₂) where 
H₁ = ideological cause, H₂ = economic cause. Explain your reasoning using Van Evera logic."
```

## Phase 3: Advanced Academic Features

### Alternative Explanation Enhancement
**Current**: 2 alternative explanations (1 eliminated, 1 active)  
**Target**: 3-5 systematically evaluated alternative explanations with LLM-generated comparative assessment

### Causal Chain LLM Assessment
**Current**: 379 causal chains identified but no quality scoring  
**Target**: LLM-based plausibility and completeness assessment for multi-step causal chains using MechanismAssessment patterns

### Cross-Case Comparative Analysis
**Target**: Multi-case analysis capabilities with systematic comparison across different historical/political cases

### Temporal Process Validation
**Target**: Enhanced temporal consistency checking with LLM-based chronological reasoning

## Phase 4: Methodological Rigor Improvements

### Evidence Quality Framework
- **Source Reliability Assessment**: LLM-based evaluation of evidence source credibility
- **Evidence Triangulation**: Systematic cross-referencing and corroboration analysis
- **Bias Detection**: LLM identification of potential selection bias or confirmation bias patterns

### Academic Publication Standards
- **Citation Integration**: Proper academic citation formatting and source tracking
- **Reproducibility**: Analysis pipeline versioning and parameter documentation
- **Peer Review Simulation**: LLM-based methodological critique and improvement suggestions

### Validation and Testing
- **Known Case Testing**: Validate methodology against well-established historical cases
- **Inter-rater Reliability**: Compare LLM assessments with human expert evaluations
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Test robustness of conclusions to parameter variations

## Technical Architecture Goals

)

# Hybrid Approach
