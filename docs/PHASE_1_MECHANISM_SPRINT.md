# Phase 1: Core Mechanism Analysis Sprint

## üéØ Sprint Objective
**Goal**: Enable process tracing of causal mechanisms - the core requirement for academic process tracing methodology

**Current Problem**: System only models events and hypotheses, missing the mechanisms that connect them. Process tracing specifically requires tracing HOW causation works, not just THAT it works.

**Success Criteria**: 
- Extract Causal_Mechanism nodes from text
- Link events to mechanisms via part_of_mechanism edges
- Test mechanism operation with evidence via tests_mechanism edges
- Connect hypotheses to mechanisms via explains_mechanism edges

## üìä Impact Assessment
**Methodology Coverage**: 60% ‚Üí 85% (+25%)
**Key Academic Methods Enabled**:
- ‚úÖ Beach & Pedersen theory-testing process tracing
- ‚úÖ Mechanism-based causal inference
- ‚úÖ Multi-step causal process analysis
- ‚úÖ Van Evera tests applied to mechanisms (not just hypotheses)

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Tasks

### 1. Configuration Layer Updates
**File**: `config/ontology_config.json`
- ‚úÖ Causal_Mechanism node type already configured
- ‚úÖ part_of_mechanism, tests_mechanism, explains_mechanism edges configured
- **Action**: Verify configuration completeness

### 2. Extraction Prompt Updates
**File**: `core/extract.py`
- **Current Issue**: Prompt restricts to [Event, Hypothesis, Evidence] node types
- **Required Changes**:
  - Add Causal_Mechanism to allowed node types
  - Add mechanism edges to allowed edge types  
  - Update examples to show mechanism extraction
  - Add guidance on mechanism identification

### 3. Enhanced Mechanism Properties
**Requirements**:
- description: Step-by-step mechanism operation
- confidence: How certain we are mechanism operates
- completeness: How complete our understanding is
- status: hypothetical/supported/refuted/partial
- testable_predictions: What evidence would confirm operation

### 4. New Edge Properties
**part_of_mechanism**:
- role: trigger/intermediate/outcome/facilitating
- sequence_position: Step number in mechanism
- necessity: How necessary event is for mechanism

**tests_mechanism**:
- probative_value: Strength of mechanism test
- test_result: passed/failed/ambiguous/inconclusive
- diagnostic_type: Van Evera types for mechanisms
- mechanism_aspect: existence/operation/completeness

**explains_mechanism**:
- certainty: Confidence in explanation
- type_of_claim: existence/operation/necessity/sufficiency
- scope: Under what conditions explanation applies

## üß™ Test Cases

### Test Case 1: American Revolution Mechanism
**Expected Mechanism**: "British Taxation ‚Üí Colonial Economic Pressure ‚Üí Organized Resistance ‚Üí Revolutionary War"

**Expected Extraction**:
```json
{
  "id": "mechanism_taxation_resistance",
  "type": "Causal_Mechanism", 
  "properties": {
    "description": "British taxation creates economic pressure on colonists, leading them to organize resistance movements that escalate into armed conflict",
    "confidence": 0.8,
    "status": "supported"
  }
}
```

**Expected Connections**:
- Stamp Act ‚Üí part_of_mechanism ‚Üí Taxation Resistance Mechanism (role: trigger)
- Boston Tea Party ‚Üí part_of_mechanism ‚Üí Taxation Resistance Mechanism (role: intermediate)
- Lexington & Concord ‚Üí part_of_mechanism ‚Üí Taxation Resistance Mechanism (role: outcome)

### Test Case 2: Mechanism Testing
**Expected Evidence Testing**:
```json
{
  "type": "tests_mechanism",
  "source": "evidence_colonial_boycotts", 
  "target": "mechanism_taxation_resistance",
  "properties": {
    "test_result": "passed",
    "diagnostic_type": "smoking_gun",
    "mechanism_aspect": "operation"
  }
}
```

## üîç Quality Criteria

### Mechanism Identification Quality
- **Specificity**: Mechanisms describe HOW causation works, not just correlation
- **Testability**: Clear predictions about what evidence would confirm/refute
- **Completeness**: Major steps in causal process identified
- **Temporal Logic**: Proper sequence from trigger to outcome

### Connection Quality  
- **Event-Mechanism Links**: Events properly categorized by mechanism role
- **Evidence-Mechanism Tests**: Evidence tests mechanism operation, not just existence
- **Hypothesis-Mechanism Explanations**: Clear claims about how mechanisms work

### Academic Rigor
- **Van Evera Integration**: Diagnostic tests applied to mechanism components
- **Source Attribution**: Evidence for mechanism operation includes text quotes
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Confidence levels for mechanism claims

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: LLM Struggles with Mechanism Abstraction
**Mitigation**: Provide clear examples and step-by-step guidance in prompt

### Risk 2: Over-complex Mechanism Extraction  
**Mitigation**: Start with 1-3 major mechanisms per case, focus on quality over quantity

### Risk 3: Circular Event-Mechanism References
**Mitigation**: Clear validation that mechanisms describe processes, not just event lists

### Risk 4: Poor Mechanism-Evidence Integration
**Mitigation**: Explicit examples of how evidence tests mechanism operation vs existence

## üìà Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets
- **Mechanism Nodes**: 2-3 per American Revolution case
- **part_of_mechanism Edges**: 8-12 (major events linked to mechanisms)
- **tests_mechanism Edges**: 4-6 (evidence testing mechanism operation)
- **explains_mechanism Edges**: 2-4 (hypotheses explaining mechanisms)

### Qualitative Assessment  
- Mechanisms describe causal processes, not just event sequences
- Evidence tests mechanism operation with proper diagnostic types
- Event roles (trigger/intermediate/outcome) properly assigned
- No circular or trivial mechanism definitions
