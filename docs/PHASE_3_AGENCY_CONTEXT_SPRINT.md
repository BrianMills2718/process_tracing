# Phase 3: Agency & Context Sprint

## üéØ Sprint Objective
**Goal**: Complete academic process tracing methodology with actor intentions, strategic interactions, and scope conditions

**Current Problem**: Missing human agency and contextual factors that drive causal processes. Process tracing often requires understanding WHY actors made specific decisions and UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS mechanisms operate.

**Success Criteria**:
- Extract Actor nodes with intentions, beliefs, and constraints
- Extract Condition nodes for scope conditions and enabling factors
- Link actors to events via initiates edges
- Link conditions to mechanisms via enables/constrains edges

## üìä Impact Assessment
**Methodology Coverage**: 95% ‚Üí 100% (+5%)
**Key Academic Methods Enabled**:
- ‚úÖ Strategic interaction analysis
- ‚úÖ Scope condition specification  
- ‚úÖ Counterfactual reasoning with actor alternatives
- ‚úÖ Complete academic process tracing methodology suite

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Tasks

### 1. New Node Type: Actor
**Properties**:
- name: Actor identification
- role: Position or function in events
- intentions: Goals and motivations
- beliefs: What they believe to be true
- constraints: Limitations on their actions

**Purpose**: Model background factors and scope conditions that enable or constrain causal mechanisms

### 3. Agency & Context Edge Types

**initiates**:
- Domain: [Actor] ‚Üí Range: [Event]
- Properties: intentionality, capability_assessment, constraint_factors
- Purpose: Actor-driven event causation with strategic reasoning

**enables**:
- Domain: [Condition] ‚Üí Range: [Event, Causal_Mechanism]
- Properties: necessity, temporal_scope, enabling_type
- Purpose: Conditions that make events/mechanisms possible

**constrains**:
- Domain: [Condition] ‚Üí Range: [Event, Causal_Mechanism]

    "constraint_type": "strategic_limitation"
  }
}
```

### Test Case 3: Strategic Interaction
**Expected Multi-Actor Analysis**:
- British Government: intentions to maintain control, beliefs about colonial submission
- Colonial Leaders: intentions for independence, beliefs about popular support
- French Government: intentions to weaken Britain, beliefs about colonial viability

## üîç Quality Criteria

### Actor Modeling Quality
- **Psychological Realism**: Intentions and beliefs reflect historical evidence
- **Constraint Recognition**: Limitations on actor capabilities properly modeled
- **Strategic Reasoning**: Actor decisions explained by intentions + constraints
- **Historical Accuracy**: Actor characterizations supported by primary sources

### Condition Modeling Quality  
- **Scope Clarity**: Clear temporal and spatial boundaries
- **Causal Relevance**: Conditions actually affect mechanism operation
- **Necessity Assessment**: Realistic evaluation of how necessary conditions are
- **Type Distinction**: Clear difference between enabling vs constraining conditions

### Strategic Interaction Analysis
- **Multi-Actor Dynamics**: Interaction between actor intentions
- **Belief Updating**: How actor beliefs change based on events
- **Strategic Responses**: How actors respond to other actor actions
- **Unintended Consequences**: Gap between intentions and outcomes

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Over-Psychologizing Historical Actors
**Mitigation**: Focus on intentions/beliefs explicitly stated in historical sources

### Risk 2: Anachronistic Actor Characterizations  
**Mitigation**: Ground all actor properties in contemporary evidence and values

### Risk 3: Condition Over-Specification
**Mitigation**: Focus on conditions that actually affected mechanism operation

### Risk 4: Strategic Interaction Complexity
**Mitigation**: Start with bilateral interactions, build toward multi-actor dynamics
