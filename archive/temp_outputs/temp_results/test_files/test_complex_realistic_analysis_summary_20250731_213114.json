It doesn't definitively prove the deal *enabled* the compromise (as opposed to, for example, both events being independently caused by a third factor).  The absence of this close timing wouldn't necessarily refute the hypothesis (the compromise might have occurred through other means, or the timing might have been slightly different).  Therefore, it's not a 'hoop' or 'smoking gun', and it's certainly not 'doubly decisive' without further supporting evidence.  It merely provides a weak indication of a possible link.",

If a secret deal existed to avoid conflict, a show of force (like a quarantine) might be expected to cause the Soviets to back down. However, the Soviets could have turned back for many other reasons (e.g., unrelated diplomatic pressure, technical problems, a change in strategic goals). The absence of Soviet ships turning back wouldn't necessarily refute the hypothesis; other face-saving measures could have been employed. Therefore, it's not a strong confirmation (smoking gun) nor a necessary condition (hoop).  It's simply suggestive, hence 'straw-in-the-wind'.",

However, this is not guaranteed, as other factors could have influenced the Soviet decision. Therefore, P(E|H) is not very high.  If the hypothesis is false, it's still possible that the Soviet ships turned back due to various other unrelated factors.  Their retreat is not very unlikely in the absence of the secret trade. Therefore P(E|~H) is also not very low. Both likelihoods have medium probabilities in this case.",
