        "The French and Indian War concluded in 1763, resulting in a British victory but leaving Britain with substantial war debts that necessitated the implementation of new colonial taxation policies.",
        "To finance the war debt incurred from the French and Indian War, Britain imposed a series of new taxes upon the American colonies; a notable example being the Stamp Act.",
        "American colonists protested against the British taxation policies, arguing that these policies violated their rights as Englishmen, as exemplified by the cry of \"taxation without representation\".",
        "The rising tensions between the American colonists and Great Britain culminated in the Boston Tea Party of 1773, a significant escalation in the colonial resistance against British rule."
