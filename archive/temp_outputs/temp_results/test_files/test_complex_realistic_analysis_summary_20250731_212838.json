The removal of these missiles was a significant concession by the US, directly addressing a key Turkish concern.  The secrecy surrounding the agreement further suggests an attempt to avoid public scrutiny, aligning with the idea of a compromise meant to be less visible.

The secrecy is crucial to the 'face-saving' aspect.  If the hypothesis is false, then a secret agreement of this nature is less likely, as there would be no need for such a major concession to achieve a different outcome. The low probability is not zero, as unrelated secret agreements could happen, but it is still quite improbable.  The exact numerical values are subjective and depend on other known contextual information, but the relative probabilities are justified.",

The absence of this close timing wouldn't necessarily disprove the compromise hypothesis (other factors could explain the withdrawal), and its presence doesn't definitively prove the hypothesis (correlation doesn't equal causation; the timing could be coincidental).

However, other factors could influence timing, making it only moderately likely (0.6). If the hypothesis is false, the close timing is still possible due to coincidence or other unrelated factors but it's less likely (0.2).

While a successful quarantine might indicate some level of Soviet willingness to negotiate (supporting the compromise hypothesis), it's not a necessary condition for a secret missile trade (the absence of turned-back ships doesn't disprove the trade).

However, other factors like pre-existing plans, unrelated diplomatic pressure, or a simple change in Soviet strategy could also explain the ships turning back, even without the secret trade.  Therefore, observing the ships turning back is not overwhelmingly likely if H is true, nor is it overwhelmingly unlikely if H is false. ",
