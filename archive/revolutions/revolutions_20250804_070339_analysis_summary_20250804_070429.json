        "The French and Indian War concluded in 1763 with France's defeat, leading to Great Britain acquiring its territory east of the Mississippi River, which subsequently prompted a significant shift in British colonial policy as Parliament imposed new taxes to compensate for wartime costs and turned control of the colonies' western lands over to British officials in Montreal.",
        "In March 1765, Parliament passed the Stamp Act, which imposed direct taxes on all official documents, newspapers, almanacs, pamphlets, and even decks of playing cards in the colonies, leading to immediate widespread colonial objection based on the principle of 'No taxation without representation' and the formation of groups like the Sons of Liberty.",
        "On March 5, 1770, a large crowd gathered around British soldiers on a Boston street, throwing snowballs, rocks, and debris, causing the soldiers to panic and fire into the crowd without an order, hitting 11 people and killing three civilians at the scene, with two more dying shortly after, an event that quickly turned colonial sentiment against the British.",
        "On December 16, 1773, a seminal event in the American Revolution's escalation occurred when Sons of Liberty activists, wearing costumes to evoke Indigenous people, instigated the Boston Tea Party, during which they boarded ships of the East India Company and dumped approximately \ufffd10,000 worth of tea into Boston Harbor in protest of the Tea Act.",
        "The British government responded to the Boston Tea Party by passing four punitive laws, collectively known as the Intolerable Acts, which closed Boston Harbor, altered the Massachusetts charter, restricted town meetings, and allowed British soldiers to be tried in Britain for crimes committed in the colonies, effectively ending self-government in Massachusetts.",
        "In late 1774, 12 of the Thirteen Colonies sent delegates to the First Continental Congress, which met inside Carpenters' Hall in Philadelphia to deliberate and coordinate Patriot resistance through underground networks of committees, culminating in a boycott of all British goods enforced by new local committees.",
        "The American Revolutionary War was launched on April 19, 1775, with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which marked the first military engagements between British forces and colonial militias, signaling the outbreak of open armed conflict that forced the British to withdraw from Boston by sea in March 1776.",
        "On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, primarily authored by Thomas Jefferson, which formally declared the Thirteen Colonies' separation from Great Britain, embodying the political philosophies of liberalism and republicanism, rejecting monarchy, and escalating the war.",
        "In 1781, George Washington and the Continental Army, with crucial support from the French Army and Navy, achieved their most decisive victory in the Siege of Yorktown, capturing roughly 7,500 British troops led by General Charles Cornwallis, leading to the collapse of King George's control of Parliament and consensus in Parliament that the war should be ended.",
        "On September 3, 1783, the British signed the Treaty of Paris, formally granting their former colonies independence and nearly all the territory east of the Mississippi River and south of the Great Lakes, thereby leading to the establishment of the sovereign United States of America as the world's first constitutional republic founded on the consent of the governed and the rule of law."
