        "The French and Indian War concluded in 1763 with France's defeat, leaving Great Britain with a significantly increased national debt of \ufffd133 million and annual debt payments of \ufffd5 million, prompting the British government to seek new revenue sources from the colonies.",
        "Following the French and Indian War, British Parliament imposed new taxes like the Sugar Act (1764) and the Stamp Act (1765) on the colonies to offset wartime costs, marking a significant shift from the previous policy of salutary neglect by directly seeking revenue.",
        "In response to the Stamp Act, representatives from nine colonies convened the Stamp Act Congress in October 1765, where they drafted a \"Declaration of Rights and Grievances\" asserting that taxation without representation violated their rights as Englishmen, leading to boycotts and Sons of Liberty protests.",
        "The British Parliament passed the Townshend Acts in 1767, placing duties on goods like tea and glass, and established a Board of Customs in Boston, leading to renewed colonial boycotts, increased military presence, and culminating in the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770, where British troops fired on protestors.",
        "On December 16, 1773, Sons of Liberty activists, disguised as Native Americans, boarded British East India Company ships in Boston Harbor and dumped \ufffd10,000 worth of tea into the water, a seminal event escalating colonial resistance against British taxation and monopoly.",
        "London responded to the Boston Tea Party by enacting the punitive Intolerable Acts, closing Boston Harbor and ending self-government in Massachusetts, which in turn spurred 12 of the Thirteen Colonies to send delegates to the First Continental Congress in late 1774 to coordinate Patriot resistance.",
        "The American Revolutionary War was formally launched on April 19, 1775, with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, following increasing tensions and British military actions, leading to the formation of the Continental Army and the siege of Boston.",
        "On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, primarily authored by Thomas Jefferson, which formally proclaimed the colonies' separation from Great Britain and articulated the Enlightenment principles of liberalism and republicanism.",
        "Following the decisive American victory at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, King George III and the British negotiated an end to colonial rule, culminating in the Treaty of Paris signed on September 3, 1783, which officially recognized the independence of the United States of America."
