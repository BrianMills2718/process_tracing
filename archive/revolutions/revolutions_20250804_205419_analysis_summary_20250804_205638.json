        "The French and Indian War ended in 1763 with France's defeat, leaving Great Britain with substantial wartime costs, which led the British Parliament to impose new taxes on the colonies and transfer control of western colonial lands to British officials in Montreal, sparking initial colonial discontent.",
        "In March 1765, Parliament passed the Stamp Act, directly taxing official documents, newspapers, and pamphlets for the first time, prompting immediate colonial objections based on their lack of representation in Parliament and leading to the formation of the Sons of Liberty and the Stamp Act Congress.",
        "The British Parliament passed the Townshend Acts in 1767, placing duties on goods like paper and tea and establishing a Board of Customs, which reignited colonial boycotts and resulted in the deployment of British troops to Boston, culminating in the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770, where soldiers fired on protestors.",
        "On December 16, 1773, Sons of Liberty activists, disguised as Native Americans, famously boarded East India Company ships in Boston Harbor and dumped \ufffd10,000 worth of tea into the water, leading London to retaliate with the punitive Intolerable Acts, which closed Boston Harbor and ended self-government in Massachusetts, thereby intensifying the revolutionary cause.",
        "In late 1774, delegates from 12 colonies convened the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia, initiating coordinated Patriot resistance through underground networks of committees, which began training colonial militias and enforcing boycotts of British goods, thus unifying the colonies against perceived parliamentary oppression.",
        "On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence, primarily authored by Thomas Jefferson, which formally proclaimed national independence, rejected monarchy and aristocracy based on liberal and republican philosophies, famously stating 'all men are created equal,' and significantly escalated the Revolutionary War.",
        "In 1781, George Washington and the Continental Army achieved a decisive victory at the Siege of Yorktown, inspiring King George III and the British to negotiate an end to colonial rule; this was formalized by the Treaty of Paris in 1783, establishing the sovereign United States of America and ending the war."
