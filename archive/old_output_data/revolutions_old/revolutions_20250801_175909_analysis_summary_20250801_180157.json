        "The French and Indian War concludes in 1763 with a British victory, resulting in substantial war debts and prompting the British Parliament to impose new taxes on the American colonies to offset these costs.  Additionally, the British government takes control of the colonies' western lands, transferring authority to officials in Montreal.",
        "The Stamp Act of 1765, imposing direct taxes on various colonial documents and materials, is enacted by the British Parliament. This action sparks widespread colonial protest due to the perceived violation of the principle of \"no taxation without representation.\"",

        "The Boston Tea Party, a demonstrative act of rebellion against British taxation, takes place on December 16, 1773.  Sons of Liberty activists, disguised as Native Americans, dumped tea into Boston Harbor to protest the Tea Act.",
        "The Battles of Lexington and Concord, marking the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, erupt on April 19, 1775. These battles represent the initial armed conflict between British troops and American colonists.",
