  "description": "In 1765, the British Parliament enacted the Stamp Act, a direct tax on the Thirteen Colonies that mandated stamps on all official documents, newspapers, and playing cards.

  "description": "The Townshend Acts, passed by the British Parliament in 1767, imposed duties on various imported goods such as paper, glass, and tea.

  "description": "On December 16, 1773, a group of colonists known as the Sons of Liberty, disguised as Native Americans, boarded British East India Company ships in Boston Harbor and dumped chests of tea into the water.

  "description": "In response to the Boston Tea Party, the British Parliament passed the Intolerable Acts in 1774. These acts included measures such as the closing of Boston Harbor, the alteration of the Massachusetts charter, and the quartering of British troops in colonial homes. The Intolerable Acts were intended to punish Massachusetts and assert British control, but they instead fueled colonial anger and resistance.",

  "description": "On July 4, 1776, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, formally declaring the Thirteen Colonies independent from Great Britain.

  "description": "British taxation policies enacted after the French and Indian War, particularly the Stamp Act and the Townshend Acts, significantly increased colonial discontent because these policies were perceived as violations of the colonists' rights as British subjects, specifically the right to representation in matters of taxation, thereby creating a sense of injustice and fueling the movement towards independence.",

  "description": "The British government's attempts to assert greater control over the colonies through measures such as the Intolerable Acts following the Boston Tea Party escalated colonial resistance because these actions were viewed as oppressive and an infringement upon colonial self-governance, pushing colonists closer to declaring independence and engaging in armed conflict to protect their freedoms.",
