        "detailed_reasoning": "The causal mechanism 'mech_imperial_control' is severely incomplete and largely undefined. Its current state consists solely of a mechanism ID and a single, undescribed constituent event ('evt_tea_act_1773').\n\n**Completeness Score (0.05):** This score is extremely low because a mechanism, by definition, requires a specified cause, a series of intermediate steps (events or processes), and a defined effect, demonstrating *how* an outcome occurs. Here, the mechanism description is empty, leaving its purpose and the causal chain it aims to explain entirely undefined. Listing only one event, without any details, does not constitute a mechanism. All necessary antecedent and consequent steps, as well as the causal logic linking them, are absent.\n\n**Plausibility Score (0.1):** The plausibility is very low due to the mechanism's undefined nature. There is no specific causal claim or pathway to evaluate for logical coherence. While 'evt_tea_act_1773' is a real historical event highly relevant to the concept of 'imperial control', its role within a specific, articulated causal mechanism is not discernible. Therefore, the mechanism, as currently presented, cannot be assessed for its internal consistency or logical soundness.\n\n**Evidence Support Level (none):** While the existence and occurrence of 'evt_tea_act_1773' itself are well-documented and supported by strong historical evidence, the *mechanism* (i.e., the specific causal links and overall process) is not defined. Without a clear causal hypothesis or sequence of events, there are no specific claims for which evidence can be marshaled or evaluated. Evidence can support the existence of an event, but not an unspecified causal relationship.\n\n**Missing Elements & Improvement Suggestions:** The primary missing element is a clear definition of what 'mech_imperial_control' is intended to explain (its cause, its effect, and the specific process). This would then allow for the identification of necessary antecedent and consequent events (e.g., earlier British acts, colonial responses, and later escalations like the Boston Tea Party and Intolerable Acts) and the articulation of the causal links between them. Currently, the mechanism is a placeholder. To improve, it needs a clear narrative of the causal flow, detailing how one event or condition led to the next in the context of imperial control dynamics, ideally leading to a specific outcome like 'intensified colonial resistance' or 'breakdown of British authority'."

There is no description of what the mechanism entails, nor are there any constituent events listed.

Consequently, completeness is rated at 0.0 as no steps are present, and plausibility is rated at 0.0 because no causal logic has been articulated to evaluate. The evidence support level is 'none' as there is no claim or context to support. All elements necessary for a functional causal mechanism are missing, as detailed in the 'missing_elements' field.
