        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism's description correctly identifies several core elements crucial to understanding how the Tea Act led to rebellion: taxation without representation, economic pressure, ideological mobilization, organized resistance, and direct action. This provides a solid conceptual foundation.\n\n**Plausibility:** The mechanism is highly plausible (0.95). The causal links between the identified factors and the onset of the American Revolution are historically well-established and widely accepted by historians. Each component (grievances, economic impact, organized action) played a significant role.\n\n**Evidence Support:** The level of evidence supporting this mechanism is strong. The events and factors described are central to the historical narrative of the American Revolution and are extensively documented in primary sources (e.g., colonial pamphlets, British parliamentary records, personal letters) and countless secondary historical analyses.\n\n**Completeness:** Despite its plausibility and strong evidence, the mechanism's completeness is assessed at 0.4 for a 'step-by-step' mechanism. The current description lists key *ingredients* or *factors* but does not explicitly articulate the *sequential causal steps* by which the Tea Act *led to* rebellion. For instance, it states 'involving' various elements, but it doesn't show *how* taxation without representation led to ideological mobilization, or *how* organized resistance transitioned into direct action, and then into a full-scale rebellion. The 'Currently Linked Constituent Events' section is empty, which reinforces that the mechanism is a high-level summary rather than a detailed process tracing. It lacks the specific events that serve as critical junctures and the immediate reactions and escalations that form the 'steps' of the mechanism. While the constituent elements are correct, the causal flow and the precise sequence of events transforming discontent into open rebellion are largely implicit rather than explicitly detailed."

        "detailed_reasoning": "The causal mechanism 'Mechanism of British imperial control and revenue extraction' describes a complex historical process. Currently, it is represented by only one specific event: the Tea Act of 1773. \n\n**Completeness (0.05/1.0):** This mechanism is extremely incomplete. A true causal mechanism requires a series of interconnected steps that explain *how* a phenomenon occurs. The single linked event, while relevant to the overall topic, provides no causal chain. It lacks antecedent conditions, the broader institutional framework, other specific policies, the methods of enforcement, the colonial reactions, or the causal links leading from policy to the outcomes of 'control' and 'revenue extraction'. It functions more as an isolated example rather than a complete mechanism.\n\n**Plausibility (0.3/1.0):** The Tea Act itself is a historically plausible event within the context of British imperial efforts to exert control and extract revenue. However, as a *mechanism* that explains the entire, complex process of 'British imperial control and revenue extraction,' it is not plausible because it is just one isolated event. A mechanism necessitates a clear causal logic connecting multiple steps and interactions to explain 'how' a broad outcome is achieved. With only one event, the 'how' is entirely missing, making the mechanism as a whole implausible as a comprehensive explanation.\n\n**Evidence Support (weak):** The existence, specific details, and purpose of the Tea Act of 1773 are extensively documented and strongly supported by historical evidence (e.g., primary legislative documents, historical accounts). However, this strong evidence pertains only to the individual event. For the *mechanism* of 'British imperial control and revenue extraction' to be supported, a much broader and interconnected set of evidence would be required, demonstrating the causal relationships between various policies, their implementation, colonial responses, and the resulting outcomes of control and revenue. Since the mechanism is currently articulated by only one event, the evidence *for the mechanism itself* is weak. While the part provided is factual, it offers almost no empirical basis for the causal flow implied by a 'mechanism' that seeks to explain a large-scale historical process."
