The causal logic connecting the Tea Act to taxation without representation, then to economic pressure and ideological mobilization, and finally to Sons of Liberty channeling discontent into direct action, is historically sound and logically coherent. Therefore, the plausibility score is high.\n\nEvidence support for this mechanism is strong. The events described are foundational elements of American history leading to the revolution and are extensively documented and widely accepted by historians. The Tea Act, 'taxation without representation,' the Sons of Liberty, and the subsequent resistance efforts are all well-attested facts.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness is moderate. While it effectively describes how the Tea Act led to 'direct action,' it falls short of fully explaining how this 'direct action' then 'led to rebellion,' as stated in the mechanism's description. The crucial missing steps are: (1) the specific identification of the direct action (the Boston Tea Party), (2) the British government's punitive response to this action (the Coercive/Intolerable Acts), and (3) the subsequent escalation where these British punitive measures unified the colonies further, pushing them from protest to full-scale rebellion/revolution. Without these subsequent steps, the mechanism stops at a critical intermediate point rather than fully explaining the pathway to 'rebellion' as its ultimate outcome."

While the initiating event (Tea Act) is present, the critical intermediate steps explaining *how* it created economic and political pressures, and the subsequent observable outcomes related to 'testing loyalty' and 'extracting revenue,' are entirely missing. The mechanism describes a process with a clear beginning, middle, and end, but only the beginning is represented by a linked event.\n\n**Plausibility (0.9):** The mechanism's described causal logic is highly plausible and historically accurate. The Tea Act was indeed a legislative measure intended to alleviate the British East India Company's financial woes, assert British parliamentary authority over the colonies, and generate revenue through the existing Townshend duties on tea. It undeniably created significant economic and political pressures on the colonies and served as a major flashpoint, effectively 'testing' colonial loyalty to British rule. The core causal claim is sound.\n\n**Evidence Support (strong):** The existence and provisions of the Tea Act (evt_tea_act) are well-documented historical facts. Furthermore, the historical impact of the Tea Act in creating economic and political pressures, leading to a test of colonial loyalty, and as an attempt to extract revenue, is widely corroborated by historical scholarship. While the current linked events are sparse, the *claim* of the mechanism (Tea Act causing these pressures and tests) is strongly supported by the consensus of historical evidence."

It describes a general causal link (ideology leading to action) but completely lacks any intermediate steps or specific processes that explain *how* this transformation occurs. As such, its completeness score is very low, as it's essentially a 'black box' without constituent events.\n\nHowever, the *plausibility* of the overall proposition is very high. The idea that ideologies play a crucial role in motivating and coordinating collective action is a foundational concept in social movements, political sociology, and collective behavior studies. Ideologies provide frameworks for interpreting reality, identifying grievances, setting goals, and legitimizing actions, all of which are critical for mobilizing individuals into collective action.\n\nConsequently, the *evidence support level* is strong. There is a vast body of theoretical and empirical literature across social sciences (e.g., sociology of social movements, political science, social psychology) that consistently demonstrates and analyzes the role of ideology in various forms of collective action, from protests and revolutions to electoral campaigns and social reform movements.\n\nThe primary missing elements are the actual causal steps that bridge the gap between abstract principles and concrete action. This includes how principles are translated into actionable ideas, how individuals adopt these ideas, how they become motivated, and how their actions are coordinated. The mechanism needs to unpack the 'mobilization' process itself, moving beyond a simple input-output statement to a chain of events and interactions."
