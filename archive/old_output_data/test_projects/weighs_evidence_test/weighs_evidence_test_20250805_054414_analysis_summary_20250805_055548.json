        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism provides a high-level, conceptual overview of how the Tea Act contributed to rebellion, outlining key factors like 'taxation without representation,' 'economic pressure,' 'ideological mobilization,' 'organized resistance,' and 'direct action.' This overarching narrative is historically accurate and highly plausible, supported by extensive historical evidence from numerous primary and secondary sources. Therefore, its plausibility and evidence support are strong.\n\nHowever, its completeness as a 'step-by-step' mechanism is low. The 'Currently Linked Constituent Events' section is empty, meaning the mechanism currently describes *categories* of actions and motivations rather than tracing a precise sequence of discrete events. For instance, it mentions 'organized resistance by groups like the Sons of Liberty' and 'direct action against British property,' but it doesn't list the specific actions (e.g., the Boston Tea Party) or the specific steps leading up to them. For a 'step-by-step' level of detail, specific historical events and their causal links should be explicitly identified and ordered.\n\nCrucially, the mechanism also omits a pivotal phase in the causal chain: the British response. The punitive measures enacted by the British Parliament (e.g., the Coercive/Intolerable Acts passed in retaliation for the Boston Tea Party) were instrumental in escalating tensions, unifying the colonies, and directly pushing them closer to open rebellion. A complete mechanism would show how colonial resistance provoked a British counter-response, which in turn fueled further colonial grievances and mobilization, ultimately leading to armed conflict and the Declaration of Independence."

        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism 'mech_imperial_control' is described solely by its high-level outcome: 'Mechanism of British imperial control and revenue extraction'. There are no constituent events or steps identified, and no original text context is provided. This complete lack of detail renders the mechanism essentially undefined in terms of its process.\n\n**Completeness Score (0.0):** The mechanism is entirely incomplete. Without any identified constituent events, actions, actors, or a sequence of causality, it is impossible to assess 'how' British imperial control and revenue extraction occurred. It is merely a statement of a phenomenon rather than a mechanism explaining it.\n\n**Plausibility Score (0.2):** While the general historical concept of 'British imperial control and revenue extraction' is undeniably plausible and well-documented, the mechanism *itself* (the causal steps) is completely undefined. Therefore, its internal causal logic cannot be assessed for plausibility. The score is not 0.0 because the high-level concept is historically sound, but it is very low because the mechanism, as a *process*, is entirely missing and thus cannot be evaluated for its internal coherence or logical flow.\n\n**Evidence Support Level (none):** Since there are no specific events, actions, or causal links defined for this mechanism, there is no specific evidence that can be assessed as supporting it. While there is abundant historical evidence for the *existence* of British imperial control and revenue extraction, this evidence cannot be linked to a non-existent sequence of causal steps within this mechanism.\n\n**Missing Elements and Improvement Suggestions:** The fundamental missing elements are the very building blocks of any causal mechanism: a sequence of events, identified actors, specific actions, and the causal links between them that lead from an initial state to the final outcome. To improve, the mechanism needs to be broken down into concrete, observable, and causally connected steps, detailing the 'how' of British control (e.g., military conquest, administrative reforms, treaties) and revenue extraction (e.g., taxation systems, trade monopolies, resource exploitation). Each step should involve identifiable actors and produce intermediate outcomes that contribute to the overall result."
