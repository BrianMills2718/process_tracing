        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism outlines a clear and historically sound progression from the Tea Act to direct action against British property, specifically culminating in the Boston Tea Party. The constituent events accurately reflect this sequence: the Tea Act (causal trigger) leads to taxation without representation, fostering economic pressure and ideological mobilization, which in turn is channeled into organized resistance and direct action. The inclusion of `evt_boston_tea_party` as a specific instance of `evt_direct_action_british_property` strengthens the concrete illustration of the mechanism.\n\n**Completeness (0.7):** While the mechanism effectively details the causal chain leading *to* the significant act of defiance (Boston Tea Party), its description states the mechanism 'led to rebellion.' The Boston Tea Party, while a crucial act of resistance, is often seen as a *prelude* or a *catalyst* to the full-scale rebellion (American Revolution), rather than the rebellion itself. The mechanism currently stops short of explaining how this direct action then escalated into the broader conflict, specifically omitting the British response (e.g., Coercive Acts) and the subsequent unified colonial reaction (e.g., First Continental Congress, formation of militias), which were critical steps in triggering the full 'rebellion.' Therefore, it is partially complete for its stated ultimate outcome.\n\n**Plausibility (0.95):** The causal logic presented is highly plausible. It aligns perfectly with the well-established historical narrative of the American Revolution's origins. The sequence from specific grievance (Tea Act) to principle violation (taxation without representation), economic impact, ideological rallying, organized dissent, and culminating in overt action is a logical and historically consistent pathway for revolutionary movements.\n\n**Evidence Support (Strong):** The events and their causal links described are foundational elements of early American history and are extensively documented and corroborated by numerous primary and secondary sources. The Tea Act, the concept of 'taxation without representation,' the role of groups like the Sons of Liberty, and the Boston Tea Party are all extremely well-attested historical facts. There is robust evidence supporting each step of this mechanism."

        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The Causal Mechanism 'mech_imperial_control' is described as a 'legislative component that created economic and political pressures necessary to test colonial loyalty and extract revenue.' Currently, only one event, the 'Tea Act of 1773,' is linked.\n\n**Completeness Score (0.25):** The mechanism is highly incomplete. While the Tea Act is indeed a 'legislative component' that aimed to create pressure and extract revenue, it represents only *one* instance within a much broader and complex 'imperial control mechanism.' To be complete, a mechanism tracing 'imperial control' through 'legislative components' would need to include other significant acts (e.g., Stamp Act, Townshend Acts, Coercive Acts) that collectively exerted pressure and tested loyalty. More importantly, a mechanism should detail the *process* or *sequence* of how these acts achieved their stated goals. The current linkage only provides an input (the Act) but does not trace the full causal chain of how this act specifically 'created economic and political pressures,' *how* those pressures 'tested colonial loyalty,' or *how* it 'extracted revenue.' It lacks the crucial colonial reactions and the actual outcomes.\n\n**Plausibility Score (0.9):** The core causal logic is highly plausible. Historically, British legislative acts, including the Tea Act, were indeed designed to exert greater imperial control, extract revenue, and in doing so, created significant economic and political pressures that challenged colonial loyalty. The Tea Act's grant of monopoly and its perceived implications for colonial self-governance are well-established historical facts that align with the mechanism's description. The mechanism's *intent* and the general *nature* of the Tea Act's effects are historically sound.\n\n**Evidence Support Level (strong):** The existence of the Tea Act of 1773, its provisions granting the British East India Company a monopoly, and the immediate colonial reactions (such as the Boston Tea Party) are extremely well-documented and undisputed historical facts. There is strong direct and indirect evidence supporting the claim that such acts were part of an imperial strategy to generate revenue and assert control, thereby creating pressure and testing loyalty.\n\n**Missing Elements & Improvement Suggestions:**\n1.  **Missing Legislative Scope:** The mechanism implies a 'legislative component' (plurality or a continuous process), but only one act is present. Adding other key acts like the Stamp Act, Sugar Act, Townshend Acts, and Coercive Acts would provide a more complete picture of the 'legislative component' of imperial control.\n2.  **Missing Colonial Response:** The mechanism describes pressure being *created* and loyalty being *tested*, but it lacks the crucial events depicting the *response* of the colonists. Events like colonial boycotts, protests (e.g., the Boston Tea Party), the formation of inter-colonial bodies (e.g., Committees of Correspondence, Continental Congress) are essential to show the effect of the pressure and the outcome of the loyalty test.\n3.  **Missing Causal Granularity:** The mechanism needs more detailed steps. For instance, how did the Tea Act's monopoly specifically create 'economic and political pressures'? This would involve explaining how it undercut colonial merchants, how it was seen as taxation without representation, etc. This level of detail is crucial for process tracing.\n4.  **Missing Outcome Trace:** The mechanism states goals ('test colonial loyalty,' 'extract revenue'), but it doesn't show whether these goals were met or how the mechanism unfolded in practice. For instance, the Tea Act largely *failed* to extract revenue due to colonial resistance, but it *succeeded* in provoking a strong loyalty test that led to further conflict. This distinction needs to be captured."
