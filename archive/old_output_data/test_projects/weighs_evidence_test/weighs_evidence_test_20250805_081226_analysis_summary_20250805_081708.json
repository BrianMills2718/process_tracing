        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism 'mech_imperial_resistance' provides a plausible and historically accurate high-level outline of how the Tea Act contributed to colonial rebellion. Its overall causal logic, moving from the Act's principles to discontent, organized resistance, and direct action, is sound and widely accepted in historical scholarship.\n\n**Plausibility (0.95):** The causal chain is highly plausible. Each step logically follows from the previous, aligning with well-documented historical events and colonial grievances. The dual impact of the Tea Act (economic and ideological) is a key and accurate insight.\n\n**Completeness (0.65):** While the mechanism correctly identifies the key causal nodes, it lacks granularity and specific micro-foundations for several steps. For instance, it states that the Tea Act 'created both economic pressure... and ideological mobilization,' but the precise mechanism by which the Act undercut merchants (e.g., bypassing middlemen, tax advantages for EIC) is not detailed. Similarly, the 'channeling' of discontent by the Sons of Liberty into 'organized resistance' is a crucial step, but the specific *actions* (e.g., boycotts, public meetings, intimidation) that constitute this channeling and resistance are absent. Finally, 'direct action against British property' is a general description; naming the specific, iconic event (e.g., Boston Tea Party) would significantly enhance completeness.\n\n**Evidence Support (Strong):** This mechanism describes a core sequence of events leading to the American Revolution, for which there is overwhelming primary and secondary historical evidence. The Tea Act, the principle of 'no taxation without representation,' the Sons of Liberty, and acts of direct resistance like the Boston Tea Party are fundamental and extensively documented aspects of American history. Scholarly consensus strongly supports this causal interpretation."

The single currently linked event, 'evt_tea_act_1773,' represents only the initial cause (the legislative component). \n\n**Completeness Score (0.2):** The mechanism is highly incomplete. While the cause is present, none of the subsequent effects or intermediate steps described in the mechanism's definition (creation of economic/political pressures, testing of colonial loyalty, extraction of revenue) are represented by linked events. It lacks the 'how' and 'what happened next' components of the process.\n\n**Plausibility Score (0.9):** The mechanism's described causal logic is highly plausible and aligns well with established historical understanding of the period leading to the American Revolution. The Tea Act was indeed a legislative measure intended to assert imperial control, extract revenue, and inherently tested colonial compliance, leading to significant pressures and unrest. The conceptual flow of the mechanism is sound.\n\n**Evidence Support Level (moderate):** The existence of the Tea Act (the linked event) provides direct evidence for the starting point of the mechanism. Furthermore, the overall historical context strongly supports the general claim that such acts created pressures and tested loyalty. However, because the subsequent crucial steps of the mechanism (the actual pressures, loyalty testing, and revenue extraction attempts) are not yet substantiated by linked events, the evidence support for the *entire traced mechanism* is not 'strong,' but rather 'moderate,' given the robust historical context that implicitly supports the overall causal chain."
