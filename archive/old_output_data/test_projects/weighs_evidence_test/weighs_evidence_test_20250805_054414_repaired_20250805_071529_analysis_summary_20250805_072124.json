        "detailed_reasoning": "The Causal Mechanism 'mech_imperial_resistance' aims to explain how the Tea Act led to rebellion. The description outlines a plausible and historically accurate causal chain involving 'taxation without representation, economic pressure and ideological mobilization, organized resistance..., and direct action.'\n\n**Plausibility (1.0):** The core causal logic presented in the mechanism's description is highly plausible and aligns perfectly with well-established historical narratives of the American Revolution. The Tea Act did indeed spark significant colonial outrage, was framed as taxation without representation, led to organized resistance, and culminated in direct actions like the Boston Tea Party, which in turn provoked British responses that escalated tensions towards rebellion. The linked events themselves are also historically accurate and fit within this general narrative.\n\n**Evidence Support (strong):** Both linked events (Tea Act 1773 and Boston Tea Party) are major, well-documented historical occurrences. The causal connections described in the mechanism (e.g., acts of resistance leading to rebellion due to specific grievances) are widely accepted by historians and supported by extensive primary and secondary source material.\n\n**Completeness (0.35):** While the mechanism description provides a good conceptual outline, the *currently linked constituent events* are significantly incomplete in illustrating the full step-by-step process. Only the initial cause (Tea Act) and one major 'direct action' (Boston Tea Party) are present. The mechanism description *itself* details several crucial intermediate steps that are not represented by specific events: \n1.  **Colonial Interpretation/Grievance:** The 'taxation without representation' and 'economic pressure' aspects are conceptual but not tied to specific events showing this colonial reaction and perception of the Act.\n2.  **Ideological Mobilization:** There are no events showing how these grievances were disseminated and how public opinion was galvanized.\n3.  **Organized Resistance:** While the Sons of Liberty are mentioned in the Boston Tea Party event, there isn't an explicit event for the *organization* or *planning* of this resistance prior to the direct action, or their broader role in mobilizing.\n4.  **British Response & Escalation:** Crucially, the mechanism aims to show how the Tea Act led to *rebellion*. The Boston Tea Party was a major act of resistance, but the rebellion truly escalated due to the British response (the Coercive/Intolerable Acts) and the subsequent colonial unity (First Continental Congress) that propelled the colonies toward armed conflict. These critical steps are entirely missing. Without them, the link from the Boston Tea Party to 'rebellion' is an unsupported leap within the current events."

        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The causal mechanism 'Mechanism of British imperial control and revenue extraction' is currently represented by only a single event: 'evt_tea_act_1773'. This makes the mechanism extremely incomplete.\n\n**Completeness Score (0.1/1.0):** A single event, even if significant, cannot constitute a 'mechanism' of control and extraction. A mechanism implies a series of causally linked steps or a process. The Tea Act is a specific policy *within* a larger system of imperial control and revenue extraction, but it doesn't describe *how* that system operates from initiation to outcome. It lacks antecedents, various methods of control/extraction, enforcement, and consequences that are integral to such a broad mechanism.\n\n**Plausibility Score (0.4/1.0):** The event itself (Tea Act granting EIC monopoly) is historically accurate and plausible as a component of British imperial control and revenue extraction. However, the 'mechanism' as presented is so sparse that it's difficult to assess the plausibility of the causal *chain*. While the act's intent was indeed tied to imperial control and revenue (aiding the EIC, asserting parliamentary supremacy), without additional steps, the 'mechanism' itself lacks the necessary causal logic to demonstrate a full process. Its plausibility rests solely on the isolated event's historical context, not on an articulated causal pathway.\n\n**Evidence Support Level (weak):** While the existence and details of the 'evt_tea_act_1773' are strongly supported by historical evidence, the 'mechanism of British imperial control and revenue extraction' as a whole is not supported by just this single event. The evidence for the broader, complex causal chain implied by the mechanism's description is absent because the chain itself is missing. Therefore, the support for the *mechanism* (as a process) is weak, as it's nearly undefined by the current evidence presented."
