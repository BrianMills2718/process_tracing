        "detailed_reasoning": "The provided mechanism outlines a highly plausible and historically well-supported causal chain from the Tea Act to rebellion. The sequence of taxation without representation, economic pressure, ideological mobilization, organized resistance, and direct action aligns well with historical events leading to the American Revolution. The evidence supporting this general mechanism is strong, as it describes a fundamental narrative in American history with extensive primary and secondary source material.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness, while rated as 'step-by-step', lacks crucial intermediate steps that connect 'direct action against British property' directly to 'rebellion'. The description implies a direct leap from actions like the Boston Tea Party to a full-scale rebellion, omitting the critical role of the British response. The punitive Coercive (Intolerable) Acts enacted by Britain in response to the Boston Tea Party were a major catalyst, significantly escalating tensions, unifying the colonies in opposition, and pushing them towards organized armed resistance. Without explicitly including this British reaction and the subsequent inter-colonial unity (e.g., First Continental Congress), the link between localized direct action and widespread rebellion is less complete. The mechanism also could benefit from a more precise articulation of how the Tea Act specifically generated 'economic pressure' beyond simply being a tax, e.g., by granting a monopoly to the East India Company which threatened colonial merchants. Therefore, while highly plausible, the mechanism can be strengthened by detailing these crucial escalatory phases."

Crucially, there are *no* currently linked constituent events. This means the mechanism is entirely abstract and lacks any specific causal steps, actions, or outcomes. \n\n**Completeness (0.0):** With no constituent events, the mechanism is completely undefined in terms of its operational steps. It's merely a title, not a 'mechanism' with identified parts or flows. Therefore, its completeness is 0.0.\n\n**Plausibility (0.0):** While the *concept* of British imperial control and revenue extraction is historically plausible and well-documented, the 'mechanism' itself, as presented here, has no internal causal logic or sequence of events to evaluate. There are no steps to assess for their logical coherence or causal relationships. As such, the specific mechanism instance cannot be deemed plausible because it literally contains no elements to be plausible. A score of 0.0 reflects that there is no 'mechanism' to assess for plausibility beyond its descriptive title.\n\n**Evidence Support (none):** Since there are no specific events or steps identified within the mechanism, there is no particular evidence that can be linked or evaluated against it. Therefore, evidence support is 'none'.\n\nTo become a functional and assessable causal mechanism, it must be populated with specific, ordered events that illustrate the process of control being established, revenue being extracted, and the means by which these occur."
