        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism provides a sound high-level overview of the causal chain from the Tea Act to rebellion. Its plausibility is very high, as the general historical narrative it outlines is widely accepted and well-supported. The level of evidence supporting this mechanism is strong, given the extensive primary and secondary historical sources detailing the events and motivations surrounding the American Revolution.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's 'step-by-step' detail is currently more of a summary than a true process trace. It lumps several critical intermediate steps and distinct causal factors together, such as 'economic pressure and ideological mobilization.' To be truly 'step-by-step,' it needs to disaggregate these and include the precise sequence of events and reactions. For instance, while it mentions 'direct action against British property,' it doesn't explicitly name the Boston Tea Party, which is the quintessential event in this mechanism. More critically, it stops at 'direct action' but states the outcome is 'rebellion.' There's a significant missing causal link here: the British response to the direct action (the Coercive Acts) and the subsequent colonial reaction (the calling of the Continental Congress, the unified colonial resistance, and the shift towards armed conflict) are crucial steps that explain the transition from a localized act of resistance to a full-blown rebellion. Without these, the 'rebellion' part of the outcome is underspecified in terms of its immediate causal antecedents from the 'direct action'."

        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism's description, 'Mechanism of British imperial control and revenue extraction,' is extremely broad, encompassing centuries of policies and actions across a global empire. The single linked event, 'evt_tea_act_1773,' represents only one specific piece of legislation from a particular period and geographic region (American colonies) and pertains to one commodity (tea). \n\n**Completeness (0.05):** The mechanism is severely incomplete. The Tea Act, while a relevant instrument of imperial policy, does not constitute a 'mechanism' on its own, nor does it represent the vast complexity of British imperial control or revenue extraction. Many essential components, such as underlying economic theories, other key legislation, administrative structures, enforcement mechanisms, actors, and outcomes, are entirely missing. It's a single data point in a vast and complex process, offering almost no insight into the 'how' of the mechanism.\n\n**Plausibility (0.85):** The mechanism description itself is highly plausible as a historical phenomenon. The Tea Act of 1773 is a historically accurate and plausible example of an imperial measure intended to assert control (by propping up the British East India Company's monopoly) and manage revenue (through duties on tea). There is no logical inconsistency between the linked event and the broad mechanism description. The plausibility score is high because the stated link (this act *is* an instance of imperial control/revenue extraction) is sound, despite the extreme lack of detail for the overall mechanism.\n\n**Evidence Support (strong):** The existence, nature, and purpose of the Tea Act of 1773 are exceptionally well-documented and universally accepted historical facts. Its role as an instrument of British imperial policy aimed at control and revenue management is strongly supported by historical evidence. Therefore, for the specific event provided and its relevance to the broader topic, the evidence support is strong. However, this strong support applies only to the *single, existing component* of the mechanism; it does not imply that the *entire mechanism* is well-evidenced, as most of its necessary parts are absent."
