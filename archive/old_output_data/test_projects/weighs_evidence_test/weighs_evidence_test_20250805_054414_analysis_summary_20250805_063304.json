This aligns perfectly with well-established historical understanding, making its plausibility score high (1.0). The historical evidence supporting these connections is abundant and robust, leading to a 'strong' evidence support level.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness is moderate (0.6). While the identified elements are correct, the description functions more as a list of contributing factors rather than a detailed, step-by-step *process tracing* of the mechanism. It lacks the explicit causal links and intermediate steps that explain *how* one factor leads to the next. For instance, it doesn't detail how 'economic pressure' specifically translated into 'ideological mobilization,' or how 'organized resistance' concretely led to 'direct action.' Missing are the specific actions, communications, and British counter-actions that fueled the escalation. The mechanism also implicitly ends with 'direct action' as the culmination leading to 'rebellion' but doesn't elaborate on the transition from such action to the broader revolutionary movement. To become truly 'step-by-step,' it needs to articulate the 'glue' between these broad categories, including specific events, communication channels, and the iterative nature of colonial action and British reaction."

        "detailed_reasoning": "The 'Mechanism of British imperial control and revenue extraction' is currently represented by only one event: the Tea Act of 1773. This makes the mechanism extremely incomplete (score 0.1). A causal mechanism requires a sequence of interconnected events, actions, and reactions that explain *how* a process unfolds from initial conditions to an outcome. The Tea Act is merely one *instance* or *component* of British imperial control, not the entire mechanism itself. It lacks the preceding causes, the full range of imperial actions, the specific pathways of influence, the responses from those subjected to control, and the ultimate outcomes.\n\nThe plausibility of the single linked event's relevance to the mechanism is very high (score 0.9). The Tea Act was indeed a significant piece of legislation designed to exert imperial control over the colonies' trade and to extract revenue, primarily by supporting the East India Company and indirectly benefiting the British treasury. The historical context firmly supports this connection.\n\nThe evidence support level is 'strong' for the specific event's existence and its historical purpose within the context of imperial control. The Tea Act of 1773 is a well-documented historical fact, and its aims are clearly understood by historians. However, this strong evidence only supports the *component* identified, not the completeness of the overall mechanism, which is largely undefined.\n\nTo improve, the mechanism needs to trace the full causal chain: from the motivations for imperial control (e.g., post-Seven Years' War debt, EIC financial woes) to a series of British policies (economic, administrative, military), detailing how these policies were *intended* to work, the colonial reactions to them, and the subsequent British responses. Only then can it adequately describe the 'Mechanism of British imperial control and revenue extraction' rather than just a single act within it."
