        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism 'mech_imperial_resistance' provides a plausible and historically accurate description of how the Tea Act contributed to the American rebellion. The overarching causal logic, moving from legislative act to grievances, organized resistance, direct action, and ultimately rebellion, is well-established.\n\n**Plausibility Score (0.95):** The causal chain outlined in the mechanism description is highly plausible and aligns well with historical consensus regarding the causes of the American Revolution. The sequence from economic/political grievance to organized resistance and direct action is logically sound.\n\n**Completeness Score (0.4):** While the *description* of the mechanism outlines several key intermediate steps ('taxation without representation, economic pressure and ideological mobilization, organized resistance, and direct action'), the *currently linked constituent events* are quite sparse. Only the initial cause (`evt_tea_act_1773`) and a major direct action (`evt_boston_tea_party`) are provided. This leaves significant gaps in the process tracing. There are no events demonstrating: \n1.  How the Tea Act specifically generated the perception of 'taxation without representation' (especially given it lowered tea prices).\n2.  The nature of 'economic pressure' for colonists or merchants.\n3.  The process of 'ideological mobilization'.\n4.  The specific organizing activities of groups like the Sons of Liberty *before* the Boston Tea Party.\n5.  The escalation from the Boston Tea Party to a broader 'rebellion'. The mechanism description is comprehensive, but the *evidence* to trace those steps through specific events is largely missing.\n\n**Evidence Support Level (moderate):** The two linked events (`evt_tea_act_1773` and `evt_boston_tea_party`) are concrete, well-documented historical facts. They strongly support the occurrence of the initial cause and a major resultant action. However, these events alone do not provide direct evidence for the *intermediate causal links* described within the mechanism's narrative (e.g., the specific mechanisms of ideological mobilization or the detailed actions of organized resistance leading up to the Tea Party, or the immediate consequences linking the BTP to 'rebellion'). Therefore, while the bookends are strong, the supporting evidence for the full step-by-step process is moderate due to the lack of granular event data for the intermediate steps."

        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism `mech_imperial_control` is broadly described as 'Mechanism of British imperial control and revenue extraction.' Currently, it contains only one event, `evt_tea_act_1773`, which describes the legislation granting the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales. \n\n**Completeness (0.05):** The mechanism is profoundly incomplete. A 'mechanism' implies a series of causally linked steps that explain how an outcome is produced. Here, we have only one isolated event. To adequately describe 'British imperial control and revenue extraction,' a mechanism would need to detail motivations, specific policies, their implementation, enforcement, the actual flow of resources, colonial reactions, and potentially feedback loops. The single Tea Act event only touches upon one aspect of policy formulation without showing its antecedents, its full causal links to control/revenue, or its consequences and broader context.\n\n**Plausibility (0.85):** The single event `evt_tea_act_1773` itself is highly plausible as a component of a mechanism for imperial control and revenue extraction. The Tea Act was a historical piece of legislation explicitly designed to benefit the British East India Company (and thus indirectly the British treasury through duties) and assert parliamentary authority over the colonies. Its relevance to the overarching mechanism description is strong. However, since there is no actual sequence of events within the mechanism, the plausibility assessment primarily pertains to the isolated event's historical accuracy and conceptual relevance to the mechanism's stated goal.\n\n**Evidence Support (strong):** The existence and nature of the `evt_tea_act_1773` are strongly supported by historical evidence. It is a well-documented and pivotal event in British imperial history and the lead-up to the American Revolution. Primary sources (parliamentary records, colonial correspondence) and extensive secondary scholarship confirm its details and purpose. The general concept that such legislation was part of a broader British strategy for control and revenue is also historically robust."
