        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The 'Imperial Resistance Mechanism' outlines a plausible and historically well-supported causal chain from the Tea Act to direct action against British property. The core steps \u2013 imposition of taxation, creation of economic and ideological pressure, channeling of discontent, and culmination in direct action \u2013 are logically sequential and align with established historical narratives.\n\n**Completeness Score (0.75):** The mechanism provides a strong skeleton of the causal process, with all major high-level steps present and well-represented by the core events (`evt_tea_act_1773_passed` to `evt_boston_tea_party`). However, its completeness suffers from a lack of granular detail regarding the 'how' and 'why' within each step. For instance, while 'economic pressure and ideological mobilization' are identified as outcomes, the specific processes by which these occurred (e.g., direct impact on colonial merchants, spread of political pamphlets) are not fully elaborated. Similarly, the methods by which Sons of Liberty 'channeled discontent' are not specified. The mechanism description is also quite concise, and could be expanded to reflect more of the detail present in its linked events.\n\n**Plausibility Score (0.95):** The causal logic is highly plausible and widely accepted within historical scholarship. The sequence from parliamentary acts causing economic and ideological grievances, leading to organized popular resistance, and culminating in overt acts of defiance, is a cornerstone of the American Revolution's origins. Each step naturally follows the preceding one based on historical evidence and common understanding of human and political reactions.\n\n**Evidence Support Level (strong):** This mechanism is supported by a wealth of primary and secondary historical evidence. The Tea Act, 'no taxation without representation' as a rallying cry, the activities of the Sons of Liberty, and the Boston Tea Party are all extensively documented and analyzed events in American history. Historians widely concur on the causal links described.\n\n**Missing Elements and Improvement Suggestions:** While the core mechanism is sound, its depth can be significantly enhanced. Several linked events (`evt_absence_french_support_pre_1776`, `evt_non_merchant_leadership_committees`, `evt_hutchinson_failed_prevent_escalation`, `evt_european_balance_of_power_influence`) appear to be contextual factors or broader influences rather than direct steps *within* the described causal chain from Tea Act to direct colonial resistance. If the mechanism's scope is truly 'Imperial Resistance,' these might be relevant but require explicit integration into the narrative. Otherwise, they dilute the focus of the stated mechanism. For true completeness of the stated mechanism, more detail is needed on the internal workings of the colonial response, such as specific economic impacts, the methods of ideological dissemination, and the organizational tactics of resistance groups. Additionally, considering the immediate British punitive response would strengthen the mechanism if its intended scope encompasses the escalation of resistance rather than just its culmination."

        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism's description, 'Legislative component (Tea Act) created economic and political pressures to test colonial loyalty and extract revenue,' outlines a causal chain from a legislative act to specific outcomes (pressures, testing loyalty, revenue extraction). However, the currently linked constituent events include only the initial cause: 'Tea Act of 1773 passed'. This leaves out all the intermediate steps that explain *how* the Act created these pressures, what the pressures specifically *were*, and *how* they manifested as 'testing colonial loyalty' and 'extracting revenue' (or attempts thereof). Consequently, the completeness score is very low, as the majority of the causal pathway described by the mechanism is not yet represented by events.\n\nDespite the low completeness in terms of explicit events, the plausibility of the mechanism itself is very high (0.95). Historically, the Tea Act was indeed designed by the British Parliament to alleviate the financial distress of the British East India Company while simultaneously asserting Parliament's right to tax the American colonies. This act directly led to significant economic and political pressures in the colonies, serving as a critical 'test' of colonial obedience and an attempt to extract revenue. The causal logic aligns perfectly with well-established historical narratives.\n\nEvidence support for this mechanism is strong. The passage of the Tea Act, its economic provisions, the political debates surrounding it, and the subsequent colonial reactions (e.g., boycotts, protests, the Boston Tea Party) are extensively documented in primary sources and robust historical scholarship. The mechanism describes a core event and its intended consequences that are fundamental to understanding the lead-up to the American Revolution."
