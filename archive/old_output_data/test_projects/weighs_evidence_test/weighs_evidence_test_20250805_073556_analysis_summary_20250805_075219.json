        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The causal mechanism, as described and supported by the linked events, effectively traces the path from the Tea Act to the Boston Tea Party, a significant act of direct action against British property. The sequence of events (Tea Act -> taxation without representation/economic pressure -> ideological mobilization -> organized resistance -> direct action) is logically coherent and historically accurate.\n\n**Plausibility:** The mechanism demonstrates high plausibility. The links between the Tea Act, the resulting grievances (economic and political), their channeling into organized resistance, and the culmination in direct action are well-established historical facts and causal relationships. The motivations and reactions attributed to the colonists are consistent with historical accounts.\n\n**Evidence Support:** The level of evidence support for the steps outlined is strong. The Tea Act, the concept of 'taxation without representation,' the role of groups like the Sons of Liberty, and the Boston Tea Party are all foundational and extensively documented historical events. The causal connections between these elements are widely accepted interpretations in historical scholarship.\n\n**Completeness:** While the mechanism is very complete in explaining how the Tea Act led to the Boston Tea Party, it is less complete in explaining how this specific event 'led to rebellion' in the broader sense of the American Revolution. The description of the mechanism states it leads to 'rebellion.' The Boston Tea Party was a major catalyst, but the direct chain of events from this 'direct action' to the outbreak of the full-scale rebellion (armed conflict) is not fully elaborated. Missing are the critical intermediate steps of British retaliation (e.g., the Coercive Acts), the subsequent escalation of colonial unity and organization (e.g., the First Continental Congress), and the ultimate triggers for armed conflict (e.g., Lexington and Concord). Without these steps, the mechanism describes the conditions and a major protest, but not the full transition to a widespread rebellion as a sustained state of conflict. Therefore, it's about two-thirds complete for its stated goal of leading to 'rebellion'."

        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The causal mechanism, 'mech_imperial_control,' is broadly described as a 'legislative component' creating economic and political pressures to 'test colonial loyalty' and 'extract revenue.' The single linked event, 'evt_tea_act_1773,' granting a monopoly on tea sales, undeniably fits aspects of this description. The Tea Act was a legislative act, it aimed to support the East India Company and ensure the sale of taxed tea (revenue extraction), and it generated significant economic (monopoly impacting colonial merchants) and political (parliamentary right to tax and control colonial trade) pressures, thereby testing colonial allegiance. Historically, the Tea Act is widely recognized as a key flashpoint in escalating tensions between Britain and the colonies.\n\nTherefore, the plausibility of the Tea Act contributing to this mechanism is high (0.9), and the evidence supporting this historical interpretation is strong. The causal logic that a legislative monopoly designed to extract revenue and assert control would create economic/political pressure and test loyalty is sound.\n\nHowever, the completeness of the mechanism, as represented by just this single event, is very low (0.25). The description 'the imperial control mechanism' implies a broader, more systematic, and likely sequential series of legislative actions and their consequences, not just one act. British imperial policy in the period leading up to the American Revolution involved numerous legislative measures (e.g., Sugar Act, Stamp Act, Townshend Acts, Intolerable Acts) that collectively aimed at achieving control and revenue, and which individually and cumulatively tested colonial loyalty. The Tea Act is but one significant part of this larger mechanism. To truly represent 'the imperial control mechanism' as a 'legislative component,' it needs to include these other foundational acts and the colonial reactions that demonstrated how the 'pressures' manifested and how 'loyalty was tested' over time."
