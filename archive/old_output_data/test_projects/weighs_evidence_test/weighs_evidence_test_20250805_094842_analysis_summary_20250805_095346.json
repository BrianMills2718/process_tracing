        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The causal mechanism provides a clear and generally accurate high-level outline of how the Tea Act contributed to the American Revolution. Its plausibility is very high, as it aligns with widely accepted historical accounts. The sequence of events \u2013 from an act of imperial taxation without representation, to economic and ideological mobilization, organized resistance, and culminating in direct action \u2013 is logically sound and historically validated. The evidence support is strong, given the extensive primary and secondary historical sources available for this period and these specific events.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness, while good for a high-level overview, could be improved by adding more granular detail, particularly regarding the 'how' of certain transitions. For instance, while the Tea Act imposed taxation without representation, the mechanism could specify that this was achieved by granting a monopoly and reducing the price of East India Company tea, thereby making the taxed tea cheaper than smuggled alternatives and implicitly forcing acceptance of the tax. Similarly, the methods by which groups like the Sons of Liberty 'channeled discontent' could be explicated (e.g., boycotts, public demonstrations, propaganda).\n\nCrucially, the mechanism ends with 'direct action against British property' but states its overall outcome is 'rebellion'. While direct action (like the Boston Tea Party) was a pivotal moment, 'rebellion' implies a broader and sustained challenge to authority, often involving a British response and a subsequent colonial escalation. The mechanism currently omits the critical step of the British reaction to the direct action (e.g., the Coercive Acts), and the subsequent colonial response to those punitive measures, which were vital in galvanizing inter-colonial unity and escalating the conflict toward outright rebellion and war. Including these elements would significantly enhance the mechanism's completeness and better trace the path from a specific act of resistance to the broader concept of 'rebellion'."

        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The causal mechanism describes a multi-stage process: 'legislative components' -> 'create economic and political pressures' -> 'necessary to test colonial loyalty and extract revenue'. Currently, only one event, 'evt_tea_act_1773' (Tea Act of 1773 passed), is linked. This event accurately represents a 'legislative component' and is a necessary first step. However, it provides no direct evidence for the subsequent stages of the mechanism.\n\n**Plausibility:** The mechanism is highly plausible (0.9). Historically, imperial powers frequently used legislative measures to assert control, generate revenue, and gauge the loyalty of their colonies. The Tea Act itself is a well-known example designed to aid the British East India Company and indirectly assert British authority, which indeed led to significant economic and political pressures in the colonies, ultimately escalating the conflict and testing colonial allegiance. The causal logic holds true within the historical context.\n\n**Completeness:** The completeness is very low (0.2). While the initial cause (legislative component) is present, the critical intermediary steps (creation of economic/political pressures) and the ultimate outcomes (testing loyalty, extracting revenue) are entirely unrepresented by linked events. The mechanism, as currently supported, is more of a 'seed' than a developed causal chain. Many crucial events that would demonstrate the 'creation' of pressures, the 'testing' of loyalty through colonial reactions, and the 'extraction' of revenue are missing.\n\n**Evidence Support:** The evidence support for the *entire mechanism* is weak. The single linked event only supports the *first part* ('legislative components') of the mechanism's description. It provides a foundational piece but does not trace the subsequent causal effects (pressures, loyalty test, revenue extraction). To strengthen the evidence, events demonstrating the 'effects' side of the causal arrow would be necessary."

It asserts a transformation from A to B but provides absolutely no intermediate steps, agents, or processes that explain *how* this transformation occurs. It's a black box. For instance, what constitutes 'ideological mobilization'? How do 'abstract principles' become 'concrete'? What kind of 'collective action' is implied? Without any constituent events or process details, it's impossible to trace the causal flow.\n\n**Plausibility Score (0.9):** Despite its lack of detail, the core assertion that ideology can drive collective action is highly plausible and widely supported by social science theory and empirical observation across fields like political science, sociology, and social psychology. The mechanism, as stated, does not contain any illogical or contradictory elements; rather, it is simply underspecified.\n\n**Evidence Support Level (moderate):** The general phenomenon described by this mechanism (that ideological mobilization leads to collective action) is robustly supported by extensive research on social movements, revolutions, political participation, and collective behavior. There is strong theoretical and empirical evidence for the existence of this causal link. However, because the mechanism itself is so underspecified in terms of its internal workings (i.e., the *process* of transformation), there is no *specific* process articulated that could be strongly supported or refuted by evidence. The support is for the conceptual linkage, but not for a detailed, testable process. Therefore, 'moderate' reflects this dual reality: strong conceptual support for the phenomenon, but weak support for the *specific, undetailed mechanism* as a process.\n\n**Missing Elements & Improvement Suggestions:** A complete mechanism would articulate the specific steps, actors, and contextual factors involved. This would include detailing the methods of mobilization, the cognitive and emotional pathways of individual belief adoption, and the organizational and social processes that aggregate individual actions into collective behavior."
