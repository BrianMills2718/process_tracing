        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism describes a fundamentally plausible and historically well-supported sequence of events leading to the American Revolution. The causal logic\u2014British policy leading to colonial resistance, which then triggers British escalation, and finally culminates in revolution\u2014is historically accurate and strongly supported by extensive evidence from primary and secondary sources. Therefore, its plausibility and evidence support are very high.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness, while capturing the major stages, is moderate. It outlines the core cause-and-effect chain but lacks granular detail on the 'how' and 'why' of certain transitions. For instance, while it mentions 'grievances like taxation without representation,' it doesn't fully explain *how* the Tea Act specifically exacerbated these, beyond simply being an 'assertion of authority.' The underlying British motivations for the Tea Act are also not specified. The transition from colonial resistance to specific 'direct action' (like the Boston Tea Party) could benefit from mentioning the organizational structures (e.g., Sons of Liberty, Committees of Correspondence) that facilitated such coordinated efforts. Similarly, the jump from 'British escalatory response (Intolerable Acts)' to 'escalating conflict' needs more detail on the colonial reactions (e.g., First Continental Congress, widespread arming of militias) that cemented this escalation. Finally, the direct events that sparked the 'American Revolution' from the 'escalating conflict' (e.g., Lexington and Concord) are implied but not explicitly stated as crucial steps.\n\nAdding these missing elements and expanding on the 'how' for each causal link would significantly improve the mechanism's completeness and provide a more robust and nuanced explanation of the process, transforming it from a high-level summary into a more detailed causal pathway."
