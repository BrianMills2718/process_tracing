        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism `mech_ColonialResistanceMechanism` provides a highly plausible and historically accurate high-level overview of the causes of the American Revolution. The core causal logic \u2013 British policies asserting authority leading to colonial resistance, which then escalates \u2013 is well-supported by extensive historical evidence and is widely accepted. Therefore, its plausibility score is very high (0.95), and evidence support is strong.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness score is moderate (0.65) because it acts more as a summary than a detailed process trace. While it correctly identifies the initial cause (British policies) and the eventual outcome (conflict/revolution), it elides crucial intermediate steps and the dynamic, reciprocal interaction between British and colonial actions. For example, it doesn't specify *how* economic pressure translates into 'principled and organized' resistance (e.g., the role of committees, pamphlets, intellectual discourse). More importantly, it omits the critical phase of British *response* to colonial resistance (e.g., punitive acts) and the subsequent colonial *reaction* to these responses (e.g., formation of the Continental Congress, arming militias), which were instrumental in the escalation to open conflict. Without these iterative cycles of action and reaction, the 'escalation' appears as a singular jump rather than a series of well-defined steps. Adding these missing elements would transform it from a plausible summary into a robust, trace-able causal mechanism."
