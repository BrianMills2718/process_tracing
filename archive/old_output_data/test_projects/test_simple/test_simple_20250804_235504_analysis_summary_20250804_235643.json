        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The causal mechanism provides a plausible high-level narrative connecting the Tea Act to the American Revolution. The initial steps regarding the Tea Act, economic pressure, and the combination with existing grievances leading to organized resistance (like the Boston Tea Party) are well-articulated and historically sound. Thus, its plausibility is high (0.9).\n\nHowever, the completeness score is moderate (0.6) because it makes a significant leap from 'organized resistance (manifested in events like the Boston Tea Party)' directly to 'eventually culminated in the American Revolution.' This skips several critical and distinct intermediate causal steps that explain how a singular act of resistance transformed into a full-blown revolution. For example, it omits the British punitive response (the Coercive Acts), the colonial reaction to these acts (leading to increased unity and the formation of the Continental Congresses), the formalization of colonial resistance, and the specific events that triggered military conflict (Lexington & Concord). While 'underlying motivations' are mentioned, a deeper dive into the ideological and historical context would further strengthen the mechanism by providing a more complete picture of the preconditions for revolution.\n\nThe level of evidence supporting this mechanism is strong. The historical connections between the Tea Act, colonial economic pressures, the 'taxation without representation' grievance, the Boston Tea Party, and its role in the lead-up to the American Revolution are extensively documented and widely accepted within historical scholarship. Abundant primary and secondary sources corroborate these causal links."
