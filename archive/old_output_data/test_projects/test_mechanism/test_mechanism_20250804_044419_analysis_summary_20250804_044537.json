        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism, 'mechanism_violation_of_principles', identifies a profoundly plausible and historically well-supported core driver of the American Revolution. Its plausibility score of 0.9 reflects the fundamental nature of the 'no taxation without representation' grievance as a primary cause of colonial rebellion. It is logically sound that imposing taxes and economic control without consent or representation would be perceived as an infringement on self-governance, a principle central to the colonists' understanding of their rights as Englishmen and free people.\n\nEvidence support for this mechanism is strong. Primary sources from the period, such as pamphlets, colonial assembly resolutions, and the Declaration of Independence itself, explicitly articulate that acts like the Tea Act were viewed as tyrannical infringements on fundamental liberties. This perspective is a cornerstone of historical scholarship on the American Revolution, with abundant documentation demonstrating colonial outrage over British attempts to assert parliamentary supremacy and tax them without their consent.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness score of 0.55 indicates that while it captures the essential causal link, it lacks the detailed intermediate steps necessary for a full process tracing of how this infringement *led to* colonial rebellion. It describes the 'what' (Tea Act causing infringement) but not fully the 'how' (how infringement transformed into widespread rebellion). Missing elements include the colonists' *active interpretation* of the Act as a violation, which was not a passive reception but an ideologically charged understanding. Crucially, it omits the *response* and *mobilization* of the colonists following this perception \u2013 the protests, boycotts, organizations, and specific acts of defiance (like the Boston Tea Party) that were direct manifestations of the perceived infringement. Without these steps, the mechanism jumps from an abstract infringement to an implied rebellion without detailing the critical human agency and collective action that bridged this gap. It also benefits from explicit mention of the Enlightenment principles that underpinned the colonists' understanding of 'rights' and 'consent'."

The causal logic \u2014 that economic disadvantage leads to opposition \u2014 is sound and widely supported by historical scholarship regarding the American Revolution.\n\n**Plausibility (1.0):** The mechanism is highly plausible. It aligns perfectly with established historical understanding of the economic motivations behind colonial resistance to the Tea Act. Monopolies inherently disadvantage competitors, and economic hardship is a strong motivator for political opposition.\n\n**Completeness (0.1):** While the *description* of the mechanism provides a good conceptual overview, its completeness as a process-traced mechanism is extremely low because 'Currently Linked Constituent Events' is empty. For a mechanism to be 'complete' in a process-tracing context, it requires specific, identifiable, and logically sequenced events that trace the 'how' from cause to effect. Without any specific events detailing the creation of the monopoly, the specifics of the financial hardship, or the precise actions constituting the 'fueling opposition,' the mechanism remains a high-level concept rather than an operationalized pathway.\n\n**Evidence Support (strong):** The *overall premise* of this mechanism \u2014 that the Tea Act economically harmed colonial merchants and fueled their opposition \u2014 is strongly supported by a vast body of historical evidence and scholarship. Historians widely agree that economic factors, particularly the threat to colonial merchants' livelihoods from the Tea Act's monopoly, were a major catalyst for opposition. While no specific textual evidence was provided *in the prompt* to link to *non-existent constituent events*, the general historical consensus provides strong support for the mechanism's core claim."

        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism's description effectively identifies the key stages of political mobilization by organized groups like the Sons of Liberty against the Tea Act. It outlines a logical progression from rallying sentiment to coordinating protests, facilitating direct actions, and ultimately amplifying resistance. This provides a good high-level summary of the process.\n\n**Completeness:** While the mechanism identifies the main stages, it lacks the detailed 'how' and 'why' within and between these stages. It functions more as a sequence of high-level activities rather than a granular causal explanation. For instance, it doesn't specify the methods used to 'rally colonial sentiment' (e.g., propaganda, networks), the organizational means of 'coordinating protests', or the specific 'direct actions' taken beyond the general term. Crucially, it doesn't clearly articulate the micro-causal links that connect these stages \u2013 how does 'rallying sentiment' concretely *lead to* 'coordinated protests'? A more complete mechanism would unpack these black boxes, showing the specific mechanisms and intermediate outcomes that drive the transition from one step to the next. Given that no specific 'Constituent Events' were provided, the assessment is based solely on the mechanism description's conceptual completeness, which is moderate.\n\n**Plausibility:** The causal logic is highly plausible. The sequence of organized groups mobilizing public sentiment, coordinating collective action, and engaging in direct action to amplify resistance is a well-established and historically recognized pattern in social and political movements. The Sons of Liberty are historically renowned for exactly these types of activities in the lead-up to the American Revolution, particularly in response to British taxation policies. The overall flow aligns perfectly with historical accounts and theories of collective action.\n\n**Evidence Support:** The mechanism describes a core aspect of colonial resistance that is robustly supported by extensive historical scholarship. The existence and actions of groups like the Sons of Liberty, their methods of agitation, and their role in escalating resistance against British policies, including the Tea Act, are foundational elements of American Revolutionary history. This is not a speculative or weakly attested claim; it's a widely accepted historical narrative, making the evidence support strong."
