        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The 'Imperial_Resistance_Mechanism' provides a highly plausible and well-supported causal chain explaining how the Tea Act spurred significant acts of resistance leading towards colonial rebellion. Its strength lies in clearly articulating the dual drivers of economic pressure and ideological principles, the role of organized groups, and the culmination in direct action. This aligns perfectly with established historical accounts of the American Revolution's origins.\n\n**Plausibility (1.0):** The causal logic is exceptionally sound. The progression from a specific legislative act (Tea Act) creating defined grievances (economic harm to merchants, violation of self-governance principles) to the mobilization of discontent by organized groups (Sons of Liberty) and culminating in direct action is historically accurate and logically coherent. This mechanism effectively captures the immediate catalysts and the pathways of colonial reaction.\n\n**Evidence Support (Strong):** Each step in this mechanism is robustly supported by extensive historical evidence. Primary sources, including colonial legislative records, pamphlets, newspaper accounts, merchant documents, and personal correspondences, alongside a vast body of secondary historical scholarship, confirm the specifics of the Tea Act, the widespread colonial opposition based on 'taxation without representation,' the activities of the Sons of Liberty, and events like the Boston Tea Party. This mechanism represents a foundational understanding of the lead-up to the American Revolution.\n\n**Completeness (0.8):** While excellent in detailing the pathway from the Tea Act to immediate, impactful acts of organized resistance (e.g., the Boston Tea Party), the mechanism is slightly less complete in fully tracing the path to 'colonial rebellion' in its broadest sense, implying a unified, widespread, and ultimately armed conflict leading to revolution. The mechanism effectively ends with 'direct action against British property.' To achieve a higher completeness score, it needs to explicitly incorporate the British response to these direct actions (e.g., the Coercive Acts) and how these punitive measures further escalated tensions, solidified inter-colonial unity, and catalyzed the formal steps towards war and independence (e.g., the convening of the First Continental Congress). Without these crucial subsequent steps, the direct link from the described 'direct action' to a full-scale 'colonial rebellion' remains implicitly assumed rather than explicitly detailed within the mechanism's steps."
