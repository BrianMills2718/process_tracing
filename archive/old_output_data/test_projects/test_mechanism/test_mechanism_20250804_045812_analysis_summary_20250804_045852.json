          "Add more granularity to 'ideological mobilization' in step (2), specifying the role of communication channels such as pamphlets, public debates, and inter-colonial committees of correspondence in spreading discontent and revolutionary ideas.",
          "Broaden step (3) to include other significant forms of 'organized resistance' that predated or accompanied direct action, such as widespread boycotts of British goods or non-importation agreements, which were also crucial means of expressing discontent.",
          "Add a subsequent step (e.g., step 5) to explicitly link the 'direct action against British property' (e.g., the Boston Tea Party) to the *British reaction* (specifically, the Coercive/Intolerable Acts), and then explain how these punitive acts further inflamed tensions, galvanized inter-colonial unity, and propelled the colonies collectively towards full-scale 'rebellion'."
        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism provides a plausible and generally accurate high-level overview of how the Tea Act contributed to the American Revolution. The sequence from perceived grievance (taxation without representation) to economic pressure, ideological mobilization, organized resistance, and direct action is historically sound and well-supported by evidence. The plausibility score is high because the causal logic between the described steps is strong and aligns with established historical narratives, making good sense of the progression of events.\n\nHowever, the completeness score is moderate (0.75) because while it captures the core flow, several elements could be more explicit or granular to fully explain the transition from the Tea Act to a full 'rebellion'. The initial link between the Tea Act's specific provisions and the resulting grievances could be more detailed. The mechanism also lacks detail on *how* ideological mobilization occurred (e.g., specific communication methods and arguments) and how economic pressure precisely led to it. Crucially, the mechanism ends at 'direct action against British property'. While events like the Boston Tea Party were pivotal, the subsequent British response (the Coercive Acts) was a critical intervening step that significantly escalated tensions, unified the colonies, and directly propelled them towards open rebellion. Without explicitly including this British reaction and its consequences, the mechanism concludes at an act of resistance rather than fully tracing the path to a broader 'rebellion'. The evidence support level is 'strong' as all described steps and their general sequence are extensively documented and accepted historical facts, widely covered in primary and secondary sources on the American Revolution."
