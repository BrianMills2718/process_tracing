        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism aims to describe the 'imperial control mechanism' through 'legislative and enforcement components' used by Britain to 'test colonial loyalty and extract revenue'. The currently linked event, 'event_tea_act_1773', is a highly relevant and accurate historical example of a legislative component and its immediate colonial reaction. However, the mechanism's completeness is low because it only provides a single illustrative event and does not fully trace the causal chain implied by its description.\n\n**Completeness (0.3):** While the Tea Act is a perfect example, the mechanism description explicitly mentions 'legislative *and enforcement* components' and Britain's *aims* to 'test colonial loyalty' and 'extract revenue'. The current event only covers one legislative act and its immediate (and arguably unintended) consequence of resistance. It lacks: 1) the *intended causal pathway* from the British perspective (i.e., *how* the Tea Act was supposed to achieve revenue or test loyalty beyond just being passed), 2) any 'enforcement components', and 3) the British interpretation or response to the 'test' results (colonial resistance). It provides a snapshot of a policy and its immediate outcome, but not the full dynamic process of 'imperial control' as described.\n\n**Plausibility (0.9):** The core causal logic presented is highly plausible and historically accurate. It is well-established that Britain used legislative means like the Tea Act to assert control, extract revenue, and test colonial obedience. The Tea Act's specific provisions (monopoly for BEIC) and its outcome (widespread colonial resentment and resistance) are also well-documented historical facts. The high plausibility reflects the accuracy of the historical relationships implied by the mechanism and its linked event.\n\n**Evidence Support (Strong):** The historical record strongly supports the existence and nature of the Tea Act, its purpose from the British perspective (to aid the struggling East India Company while maintaining the principle of parliamentary taxation), and its direct role in escalating colonial resistance leading to events like the Boston Tea Party. The broader concept of British imperial control through legislation and enforcement is also extensively documented in historical scholarship."

        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism 'mechanism_imperial_resistance' outlines a highly plausible and historically well-supported causal pathway from the Tea Act to rebellion. Its plausibility score is 1.0 because the sequence of perceived taxation without representation, leading to economic pressure, organized discontent, and culminating in direct action, is a widely accepted and logical progression that characterized the lead-up to the American Revolution. Evidence support is 'strong' given the extensive historical documentation, numerous primary sources (e.g., colonial newspapers, personal letters, official British records), and broad academic consensus surrounding the events of the American Revolution, particularly the Boston Tea Party and its antecedents.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness score is assessed at 0.65. While it correctly identifies the major stages, it lacks the granular detail necessary for a truly comprehensive process tracing analysis. The description remains somewhat high-level, using broad terms like 'economic pressure' and 'ideological mobilization' without specifying the precise micro-mechanisms or specific events through which these unfolded. For instance, it doesn't explicitly state *how* the Tea Act exerted economic pressure (e.g., the East India Company's monopoly bypassing colonial merchants and affecting the price of smuggled tea). Similarly, 'ideological mobilization' could be strengthened by mentioning specific avenues like the role of pamphlets, public debates, or the committees of correspondence in disseminating revolutionary ideas and organizing resistance.\n\nCrucially, the mechanism moves from 'channeling discontent' directly to 'direct action against British property' without explicitly mentioning the immediate trigger events (e.g., the arrival of the tea ships in Boston Harbor and the governor's refusal to allow them to leave without unloading). Furthermore, while 'direct action' (like the Boston Tea Party) is a key step, the leap to 'rebellion' could be better elaborated by including the subsequent British response (e.g., the Coercive/Intolerable Acts), which played a critical role in escalating the conflict from acts of localized resistance to broader, unified colonial rebellion, compelling the calling of the First Continental Congress. Adding these missing elements would transform this strong outline into a more detailed and analytically robust causal mechanism."
