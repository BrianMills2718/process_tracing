        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism 'mechanism_imperial_resistance' provides a plausible high-level causal pathway from the Tea Act to organized resistance leading to direct action. The logical progression from perceived grievance (taxation without representation) to economic and ideological responses, through organized groups, and finally to direct action, aligns well with historical accounts of the lead-up to the American Revolution. The sequence is coherent and historically accurate.\n\n**Completeness (0.75):** The mechanism provides the essential macro-steps of the causal pathway. It starts with the inciting event (Tea Act) and concludes with the specified outcome (direct action against British property). However, each step is described at a high level, lacking the micro-foundations and specific process details that would fully explain *how* each transition occurs. For instance, 'ideological mobilization' and 'channeling discontent' are significant processes that could be further decomposed. It doesn't detail the specific communication channels, the exact nature of economic harm, or the precise tactics used by resistance groups. Therefore, while comprehensive at a summary level, it lacks deeper granularity.\n\n**Plausibility (0.95):** The causal logic is highly plausible and robust. The links between the steps\u2014legislation leading to grievance, grievance leading to mobilization, and mobilization leading to direct action\u2014are well-established in both historical context and general theories of social and political movements. This mechanism accurately reflects a widely accepted historical narrative concerning the causes of colonial resistance against British rule.\n\n**Evidence Support (strong):** There is overwhelming historical evidence supporting this mechanism. Primary sources (colonial newspapers, pamphlets, correspondence, official British documents) and extensive secondary historical scholarship consistently validate each step of this pathway, particularly concerning the events surrounding the Tea Act and the Boston Tea Party. This mechanism describes a core, well-documented aspect of American colonial history."
