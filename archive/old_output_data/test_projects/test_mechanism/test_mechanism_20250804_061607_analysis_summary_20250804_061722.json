        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism outlines a highly plausible and historically accurate causal chain leading from the grievances surrounding the Tea Act to significant acts of colonial resistance. Each step logically follows from the previous one, reflecting well-established historical dynamics.\n\n**Step 1:** Clearly identifies the core ideological grievance ('taxation without colonial representation violated self-governance'), which was a fundamental principle of colonial opposition.\n**Step 2:** Plausibly links this perceived violation to two crucial outcomes: economic pressure (which was indeed a significant factor due to the Tea Act's specific provisions for the East India Company) and ideological mobilization around constitutional principles.\n**Step 3:** Correctly identifies the role of organized groups like the Sons of Liberty in channeling diffuse discontent into coordinated action, a critical component of social movements and resistance.\n**Step 4:** Culminates in 'direct action against British property,' which is a well-documented outcome (e.g., the Boston Tea Party) and a clear manifestation of organized resistance.\n\n**Completeness (0.75):** The mechanism provides a strong framework, covering the essential stages from grievance to organized action. However, it could be more complete by: 1) Explicitly stating the *specific economic provisions* of the Tea Act (e.g., East India Company's monopoly, impact on colonial merchants) that generated the economic pressure in step (2). The current phrasing 'taxation without colonial representation' is a principle, but the *economic design* of the Tea Act was key to merchant opposition. 2) Elaborating on the *diffusion* of discontent and the *broader public mobilization* methods beyond just 'channeling' by organized groups (e.g., the role of widespread communication, public meetings). 3) If 'rebellion' in the mechanism's description implies the full-scale Revolutionary War, the mechanism currently stops at a major act of resistance (like the Boston Tea Party) and doesn't explicitly link this direct action to the subsequent British punitive measures (e.g., Intolerable Acts) that directly precipitated the movement towards armed conflict. However, if 'rebellion' refers to these significant acts of defiance, it is more complete within that scope.\n\n**Plausibility (0.95):** The causal logic is exceptionally strong. Each link is well-supported by historical evidence and generally accepted historical interpretations. The progression from grievance to economic and ideological impact, through organization, and finally to direct action, is a coherent and logical sequence for understanding the origins of colonial resistance.\n\n**Evidence Support (Strong):** There is overwhelming historical evidence, including primary sources (colonial documents, correspondence, newspaper accounts) and extensive secondary historical research, that robustly supports each component and the overall causal chain described in this mechanism. The events and dynamics are central to the study of the American Revolution."

        "detailed_reasoning": "The provided mechanism description outlines a general causal relationship between British trade policies/enforcement and colonial behavior, but it entirely lacks the specific intermediate steps that connect the cause to the effect. It frames the mechanism as a *question* ('whether predicted increases...materialized and how they impacted...') rather than a detailed explanation of the causal pathway. \n\n**Completeness (0.1/1.0):** The mechanism is extremely incomplete. It identifies a broad input (British trade policies and enforcement) and a broad output (impact on colonial behavior), but provides no constituent events or logical steps that explain *how* this impact occurs. The 'process by which' is completely undefined. Without these steps, it's merely a high-level hypothesized relationship rather than a traceable mechanism.\n\n**Plausibility (0.8/1.0):** The general premise that British trade policies and their enforcement could impact colonial behavior is historically very plausible and widely accepted. The fundamental causal link is sound. However, the plausibility score is not higher because the *specifics* of the mechanism are entirely absent. Without detailing *how* this happens, the specific logical flow cannot be fully assessed for internal consistency, though the overarching concept is sound.\n\n**Evidence Support (none):** No specific evidence or data points are provided within the prompt to support the existence or operation of this mechanism. The description itself poses questions about whether predictions materialized, implying it's a hypothesis for investigation rather than a supported mechanism. The prompt also states 'Current Confidence: N/A' and 'Current Level of Detail: N/A', reinforcing the lack of explicit evidence presented."
