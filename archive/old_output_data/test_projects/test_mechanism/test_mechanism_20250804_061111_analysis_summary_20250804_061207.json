        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism effectively traces the causal pathway from the Tea Act to significant direct action against British property. Step 1 accurately identifies the violation of principles through taxation without representation as a core grievance. Step 2 correctly incorporates both economic pressure (threatening colonial merchants) and ideological mobilization as key drivers of discontent. Step 3 highlights the crucial role of organized groups like the Sons of Liberty in channeling this discontent into collective action. Step 4 then points to the culmination in direct action, exemplified by events like the Boston Tea Party, which are well-established historical facts. The causal logic between these four steps is highly plausible and historically accurate, making the initial segment of the mechanism very strong.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's stated outcome is 'rebellion,' and while the direct action was a critical turning point, it was not the rebellion itself but rather a major *trigger* for it. The mechanism omits the immediate and crucial British counter-response (e.g., the Coercive/Intolerable Acts) and the subsequent colonial reaction to these punitive measures. It was this escalation, particularly the British attempts to reassert control and the unified colonial resistance that followed, that truly transformed localized direct action into a widespread movement towards open rebellion and revolution. Therefore, while the steps leading up to direct action are complete and well-supported, the crucial links connecting that direct action to the broader 'rebellion' are missing, reducing the overall completeness score. Evidence for the steps provided is robust and widely available in historical scholarship."

        ],
        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism, as described, outlines a plausible high-level narrative: grievances lead to action, with a key event (Boston Tea Party) serving as a trigger. However, it functions more as a broad statement than a detailed causal mechanism. \n\n**Completeness (0.3):** The mechanism is highly abstract and lacks critical intermediate steps. It jumps from 'abstract constitutional grievances' directly to the 'Boston Tea Party' as a 'decisive trigger' that 'cemented transformation' into 'concrete revolutionary action.' The 'how' of this transformation is largely a black box. We are missing the specific grievances, the pre-Tea Party escalation of resistance, the precise nature of the Tea Party as a trigger (what specific actions or decisions were made by whom), the crucial British response, and the subsequent colonial reactions that truly 'cemented' revolutionary action. Without these steps, the causal chain is incomplete.\n\n**Plausibility (0.8):** The overarching narrative that constitutional grievances led to revolutionary action, with the Boston Tea Party being a pivotal moment, is historically well-established and highly plausible. The general concept of a 'trigger event' in a larger transformation is also sound. The low score for completeness prevents a higher plausibility score, as the specific *mechanism* (the detailed causal links) is not yet articulated enough to be fully assessed for internal logical coherence beyond the very high-level concept.\n\n**Evidence Support (Moderate):** Historical evidence strongly supports the existence of 'abstract constitutional grievances' (e.g., 'no taxation without representation'), the occurrence of the Boston Tea Party, and the eventual shift to 'concrete revolutionary action' (e.g., armed conflict and declarations of independence). Many historians interpret the Boston Tea Party and the subsequent British punitive measures (Intolerable Acts) as key turning points that accelerated the move towards revolution. However, because the *mechanism itself* is currently so abstract and lacks specific intermediate causal links, the evidence directly supports the *components* and *general progression* but not the *detailed, step-by-step causal pathway* that a fully articulated mechanism would require. Therefore, while the historical events are well-documented, the *specific causal logic* of the mechanism, due to its lack of detail, receives 'moderate' support rather than 'strong' for the mechanism as a whole."
