        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism 'Escalation of conflict: British policies provoking colonial grievances, leading to protests and organized resistance, escalating to armed conflict and ultimately independence' is a well-established historical narrative, providing a strong foundation for its plausibility. The listed events generally cover the major phases outlined in the mechanism description: British policies (E_012, E_015, E_021), colonial protests/resistance (E_014, E_019, E_017, E_022), armed conflict (E_003, E_002, E_007), and independence (E_006, E_010). This comprehensive coverage of key milestones contributes to a moderate-to-high completeness score.\n\nPlausibility is very high (0.95) because the sequence of events and the overarching causal logic align perfectly with the widely accepted historical understanding of the American Revolution. There are no contradictory events or illogical jumps in the general progression.\n\nEvidence support is strong. All listed events are undisputed historical facts, and the causal relationships between these types of events (e.g., taxation leading to protest, punitive laws escalating resistance) are robustly supported by extensive historical scholarship and primary sources.\n\nHowever, the completeness score is not higher because the mechanism, while strong on macro-level events, lacks explicit 'process-level' or 'micro-mechanism' events that detail *how* one stage causally leads to the next. For instance, the 'provoking colonial grievances' step is largely implied by the imposition of taxes but doesn't include events representing the *formation* or *spread* of specific grievances (e.g., 'no taxation without representation' becoming widespread ideology). Similarly, the 'escalating to armed conflict' part could benefit from more specific events detailing the intermediate steps between the First Continental Congress and the Battles of Lexington and Concord. The mechanism also lacks events showing the explicit British decision-making processes that led to punitive laws in response to colonial actions. Adding such elements would significantly enhance the explanatory power and completeness of the mechanism by showing the 'how' and 'why' behind the transitions."

The core logic\u2014that a British shift from salutary neglect to direct intervention undermined colonial self-rule, leading to resentment and a desire for independence\u2014is sound and historically verifiable.\n\nHowever, the completeness of the mechanism, as represented by its currently linked constituent events, is moderate. While the mechanism description itself is robust and accurately captures the broad causal chain, the provided events (E_048, E_011, E_012) offer only a partial illustration of the described process. E_011 (Defeat of France in F&I War) correctly identifies a major catalyst for Britain's policy shift, and E_048 (Royal Proclamation) and E_012 (Imposition of new taxes) are valid examples of early direct intervention.\n\nWhat is missing are granular events that fully trace the progression from initial intervention to widespread resentment and desire for independence. Specifically, the mechanism needs more events detailing the full range of 'direct interventions' mentioned (e.g., other key acts like the Stamp Act, Quartering Acts, Townshend Acts, Intolerable Acts). Crucially, there are insufficient events showing the *colonial response* to these interventions (e.g., boycotts, protests, formation of resistance organizations like the Sons of Liberty, and inter-colonial cooperation such as the Stamp Act Congress or Committees of Correspondence). The process by which 'established colonial self-rule' was *undermined* and 'resentment' was *fostered* also lacks specific illustrative events, beyond just the imposition of acts. Events showing how this resentment gradually coalesced into a desire for independence (e.g., First Continental Congress, Paine's Common Sense, Declaration of Independence) are also absent.\n\nAdding these missing events and potentially intermediate causal steps would significantly enhance the mechanism's completeness, allowing for more robust process tracing of how specific British actions led to the erosion of self-governance and the eventual desire for independence.\"\n}\n```"

        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism 'Mobilization of colonial resistance' is well-defined and includes key actors (Sons of Liberty, Committees of Correspondence) and outcomes (protest, enforce boycotts, unify efforts). The constituent events largely support this description, covering actions of the Sons of Liberty, the creation of Committees of Correspondence, various boycotts, and the unifying efforts of the First Continental Congress. This aligns well with historical understanding of colonial resistance.\n\n**Completeness (0.8):** The mechanism provides a strong framework for understanding the mobilization. It effectively traces the role of key groups and their actions from early resistance (implied by Sons of Liberty actions) to more formalized intercolonial coordination (Committees of Correspondence, First Continental Congress). However, it lacks explicit events detailing the *initial emergence* of the Sons of Liberty as a response to a specific British policy (like the Stamp Act), making the 'emergence' aspect of the mechanism slightly less complete. While E_053 describes Sons of Liberty actions, it doesn't cover their genesis. Similarly, the *process* of how Committees of Correspondence became truly 'coordinated networks' across colonies could be further detailed beyond just their creation (E_068) and later coordination by the FCC.\n\n**Plausibility (0.9):** The causal logic is highly plausible. Historically, the Sons of Liberty and the Committees of Correspondence were pivotal in organizing and escalating colonial resistance against British policies. Their activities, as described by the events (protests, boycotts, communication, unifying efforts), directly led to the stated outcomes of the mechanism. The progression from local, direct action to intercolonial coordination and unified resistance is historically accurate and causally sound.\n\n**Evidence Support (strong):** The constituent events listed are all well-established and widely documented historical occurrences. The actions of the Sons of Liberty, the creation and role of the Committees of Correspondence, the implementation of colonial boycotts, the significance of the Massachusetts Circular Letter, and the coordinating functions of the First Continental Congress are all extensively supported by primary and secondary historical sources. The historical consensus firmly backs the existence and impact of these events in the lead-up to the American Revolution."

This establishes the 'input' side of the mechanism well. However, the mechanism's description details crucial intermediate steps: 'created economic burdens and perceived injustices, motivating merchant opposition and broader colonial protests.' The current linked events *do not explicitly capture these intermediate steps or the immediate outcomes*. They only list the antecedent policies. While these policies *would* lead to the described effects, the mechanism, as represented by its constituent events, lacks the specific events that show *how* these burdens were created, *how* they were perceived as unjust, and *how* they specifically motivated opposition. Therefore, the 'transmission' or 'process' part of the mechanism tracing is incomplete. The plausibility of the mechanism itself is very high, as the link between mercantilist policies, economic grievance, and colonial protest is a well-established and foundational explanation for the American Revolution. Historically, the existence of these acts and their role in generating colonial discontent are strongly supported by a vast body of evidence. Thus, the overall evidence support for the causal logic of this mechanism is strong, even if the provided events only cover the initial conditions."
