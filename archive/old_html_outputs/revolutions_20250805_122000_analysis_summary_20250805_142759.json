This broad coverage gives the mechanism a strong foundation for plausibility.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness, while good at a high level, could be significantly improved by adding more granular events. It currently outlines the 'what' but could benefit from more detail on the 'how' and 'why' of the transitions. Specifically, events detailing the evolution of colonial grievances beyond just the policies themselves, the full spectrum of non-violent resistance (e.g., boycotts, committees of correspondence), and the British escalatory responses to this resistance are largely missing. The crucial role of the Second Continental Congress in moving from resistance to formal war and independence is also a notable omission. Finally, the formal end of the conflict and recognition of independence via the Treaty of Paris would provide a more complete narrative arc.\n\nThe mechanism is strongly supported by historical evidence. The events listed are well-documented historical facts, and the overarching causal narrative (policies -> grievances -> resistance -> war -> independence) is a foundational understanding of the American Revolution, backed by extensive primary and secondary source material."

        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism description itself is a highly plausible and widely accepted historical explanation for the causes of the American Revolution. It accurately identifies the shift in British policy from 'salutary neglect' to 'direct intervention' as the root cause, leading to the undermining of colonial self-governance, which in turn fostered resentment and a desire for independence. Therefore, the plausibility score is high (0.9).\n\nEvidence supporting this mechanism is extensive and comes from a vast body of primary and secondary historical sources, including colonial records, British parliamentary acts, contemporary pamphlets, and modern historical scholarship. The sequence of events and their impact are well-documented, leading to a 'strong' evidence support level.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness, as represented by the currently linked constituent events, is quite low (0.4). While the 'Defeat of France in French and Indian War' is a crucial antecedent that explains the *why* behind Britain's policy shift, and 'Issuance of Royal Proclamation of 1763' and 'Imposition of new taxes by British Parliament' are examples of 'direct intervention', they only represent the initial steps of the mechanism. The current events do not adequately trace the full causal chain described in the mechanism: 'undermined established colonial self-rule', 'fostering deep resentment', and the eventual 'desire for independence'.\n\nCrucially missing are specific events illustrating *how* self-rule was undermined (e.g., specific parliamentary acts challenging colonial legislative power, removal of self-governing privileges), instances of direct 'quartering', other significant 'governance changes' (e.g., Intolerable Acts), and, most importantly, the *colonial reactions* that demonstrate the fostering of resentment (e.g., protests, boycotts, Stamp Act Congress, Boston Tea Party). Furthermore, the transition from general resentment to a specific 'desire for independence' is not supported by any linked events, which would require including events like the Continental Congresses or the publication of 'Common Sense'. The current events only provide the initial actions by the British, but not the crucial intermediate steps and the direct outcome on colonial sentiment and political aims."

        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism M_003 describes a crucial aspect of the American Revolution: the mobilization of colonial resistance through organized groups and networks. The currently linked events provide a good foundation, demonstrating the activities of the Sons of Liberty (E_053) and the emergence of the Committees of Correspondence (E_068), as well as coordinated actions like boycotts (E_059, E_079) and unified resistance efforts (E_081, E_060).\n\n**Plausibility:** This mechanism is highly plausible (0.95). The emergence and actions of groups like the Sons of Liberty and Committees of Correspondence are well-established historical facts central to the pre-Revolutionary period. The causal link from their organization and activities to the mobilization of colonial resistance is a widely accepted historical narrative. There are no logical inconsistencies or improbable steps in the described sequence.\n\n**Evidence Support:** The evidence supporting this mechanism is strong. All listed events (Sons of Liberty actions, creation of Committees of Correspondence, colonial boycotts, the circular letter, and the First Continental Congress's actions) are robustly documented and form a cornerstone of American historical scholarship. The existence and significant roles of these groups and actions in fostering resistance are beyond dispute.\n\n**Completeness:** While good, the completeness score is set at 0.6. The mechanism provides a strong overview of the *activities* of these groups and their role in *unified efforts*. However, it lacks crucial elements regarding the *initial emergence* and the *full scope* of the 'organized groups' and 'coordinated networks' implied by the mechanism description. \n\nSpecifically, there's no explicit event for the *formation* of the Sons of Liberty, only their subsequent actions. The direct British policies that *triggered* this initial emergence (e.g., the Stamp Act, which historically led to the formation of the Sons of Liberty) are not present. Similarly, while E_068 mentions Samuel Adams creating Committees of Correspondence, the mechanism would be more complete by showing their *proliferation and intercolonial connection* (i.e., how they became truly 'coordinated networks' across colonies), not just their initial creation. More explicit linkages between the Committees of Correspondence's communication efforts and the convening of the First Continental Congress would also strengthen the causal chain. Adding specific examples of enforcement of boycotts by the Sons of Liberty would also provide more detail to their 'enforcing boycotts' role. Without these elements, the mechanism describes *what* happened but could be more explicit about *how* these specific groups and networks *emerged* and *expanded* to facilitate the broad 'mobilization' of colonial resistance."

There are no explicit events representing the 'creation of economic burdens,' the 'perception of injustices,' the 'motivation of merchant opposition,' or the 'broader colonial protests.' To be complete, the mechanism would need observable events that trace how the policies led to economic strain, how that strain fostered a sense of injustice, and how these sentiments translated into organized resistance and popular protest. The mechanism's description outlines a clear causal pathway, but the current linked events only represent the very first step.\n\n**Plausibility Score (0.9):** The mechanism's causal logic is highly plausible and aligns with well-established historical interpretations of the causes of the American Revolution. The idea that British mercantilist policies and new taxes created economic grievances and a sense of injustice, leading to colonial resistance, is a cornerstone of historical scholarship. The individual acts listed are historically accurate examples of such policies. The mechanism conceptually holds together very well, even if the event-level process tracing is currently thin.\n\n**Evidence Support Level (strong):** The existence of the British acts listed (Navigation Acts, Molasses Act, Sugar Act) is unequivocally supported by historical records. Furthermore, the historical record provides strong evidence that these acts did indeed create economic burdens for colonists, were widely perceived as unjust, and directly led to significant merchant opposition and broader colonial protests.
