        "detailed_reasoning": "The mechanism 'Escalation of conflict: British policies provoking colonial grievances, leading to protests and organized resistance, escalating to armed conflict and ultimately independence' is a well-established historical narrative. The provided constituent events cover the major phases of this mechanism effectively.\n\n**Completeness (0.8):** The mechanism's core stages are well-represented: British policies (E_012, E_015, E_021), colonial protests/resistance (E_014, E_019, E_017, E_022), armed conflict (E_002, E_003, E_007), and independence (E_006, E_010). Most critical turning points are included. However, some aspects of 'escalation' could be more explicitly detailed. While the British policies are listed, the explicit *British responses* to colonial resistance that further fueled escalation (e.g., military actions, specific punitive measures beyond the Intolerable Acts that intensified conflict) are not always present as distinct events. The ideological development of colonial grievances beyond simple reaction to taxes could also be more robustly represented. The exact sequential causal links between some events (e.g., how the Boston Tea Party directly led to the Intolerable Acts, and how the Intolerable Acts directly led to the First Continental Congress) are implied by the chosen events, but the 'cause' for each 'effect' event is not explicitly captured as a distinct element of the chain if it's not a named event. The current list implicitly relies on common historical knowledge to fill these gaps.\n\n**Plausibility (0.95):** The causal logic is exceptionally plausible. It aligns perfectly with the widely accepted historical understanding of the American Revolution. British attempts to assert greater control and extract revenue after the Seven Years' War directly led to colonial resistance, which through a series of escalating events and reactions, culminated in war and independence. The events listed are factually accurate and fit cohesively into this narrative.\n\n**Evidence Support (strong):** The events comprising this mechanism are thoroughly documented in historical records. There is a vast body of primary sources (e.g., parliamentary acts, colonial assembly minutes, letters, pamphlets, military reports) and secondary scholarly works that corroborate the occurrence of these events and their causal relationships. The narrative of British policies leading to colonial grievances and then to armed conflict and independence is a cornerstone of American history, supported by overwhelming evidence."

The core causal logic that a shift from salutary neglect to direct intervention undermined self-rule and fostered resentment is well-established. Evidence support is strong, as this mechanism forms a foundational narrative of the American Revolution, supported by extensive primary and secondary sources.\n\nHowever, the mechanism's completeness is moderate (0.6). While the initial trigger (Defeat of France in French and Indian War) and early British interventions (Royal Proclamation, new taxes) are present, the current constituent events do not fully trace the entire causal chain outlined in the mechanism description. Specifically, there are missing elements regarding: \n1.  **Comprehensive British Intervention:** The mechanism mentions 'taxes, quartering, governance changes,' but only general taxes and the Royal Proclamation are represented. Specific acts like the Quartering Acts, Stamp Act, Townshend Acts, Tea Act, and Intolerable Acts are crucial for detailing the 'direct intervention' and 'governance changes' mentioned.\n2.  **Colonial Response and Undermining:** The mechanism states 'undermined established colonial self-rule, fostering deep resentment.' The listed events are the British *causes*, but the *effects* on colonial self-rule and the *process* of resentment building through colonial reactions (e.g., protests, boycotts, organized resistance like the Sons of Liberty, Stamp Act Congress) are not detailed as specific events. \n3.  **Escalation to Desire for Independence:** The mechanism ends with 'desire for independence,' but the specific events that signify this escalation (e.g., Boston Massacre, Boston Tea Party, Continental Congresses) are absent.\n4.  **Baseline of Salutary Neglect:** While the mechanism begins with a 'shift from salutary neglect,' there isn't an explicit event or description of this baseline period to provide context for the 'erosion' of self-governance.\n\nAdding these missing elements would significantly strengthen the mechanism's completeness by detailing the specific actions, reactions, and escalations that led from initial British policy shifts to deep colonial resentment and the desire for independence."

The provided constituent events offer strong evidence for the existence and activities of these entities and their functions. E_053 demonstrates Sons of Liberty's active role in protest and boycotts, E_068 shows the creation of CoCs, and E_059, E_079, E_081, and E_060 highlight various forms of boycott efforts and inter-colonial coordination, including the culmination in the First Continental Congress. This aligns well with the stated purposes of the mechanism.\n\n**Plausibility:** The mechanism's causal logic is highly plausible and historically accurate. It describes a well-established sequence of events in the American Revolution, where colonial grievances led to organized resistance, evolving from local groups to inter-colonial networks.\n\n**Completeness:** While the events cover the core components, there are some gaps. The mechanism states 'Emergence' of groups/networks, but for the Sons of Liberty, the provided event (E_053) describes their *actions* rather than their initial *formation* or *emergence* as an organized entity. More significantly, the mechanism implies a reaction to 'British policies,' but no specific events are provided that act as the initial *trigger* or cause for the mobilization. The mechanism would be more complete by explicitly linking the emergence of these groups/networks to the specific policies that necessitated their formation. Furthermore, while coordination is evident, the granular 'how' of their operations (e.g., specific methods of information exchange, how boycotts were enforced beyond general threats) is not fully detailed by the current events. Therefore, a score of 0.7 reflects that the main actors and their broad functions are present, but the initial trigger and finer operational details are missing.\n\n**Evidence Support:** The current events provide strong empirical support for the mechanism. Each key component of the mechanism description (organized groups, coordinated networks, protesting, enforcing boycotts, unifying efforts) is directly supported by one or more events. The events show the *products* of emergence (active SoL, CoC being created) and the *outcomes* of the coordination and protest, directly substantiating the mechanism's claims."
