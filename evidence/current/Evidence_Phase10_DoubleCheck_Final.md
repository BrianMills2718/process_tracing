# Evidence: Phase 10 Double-Check - Actual Results

## Critical Findings

### ✅ TRUE: 80.6% Compliance Achieved
- **Validated**: 54/67 files are compliant
- **Calculation verified**: (54/67) * 100 = 80.6%
- **Improvement from baseline**: 70.1% → 80.6% (+10.5%)

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY TRUE: Files "Fixed" But Not Fully Compliant

Several files I claimed as "fixed" still have violations:

#### 1. **advanced_van_evera_prediction_engine.py**
- ✅ FIXED: Keyword matching in _calculate_domain_relevance (line 680)
- ✅ FIXED: Most hardcoded confidence values (lines 822, 828, 834, 839)
- ❌ MISSED: Line 1011 still has `base_confidence = 0.6`

#### 2. **content_based_diagnostic_classifier.py**
- ✅ FIXED: Main confidence extraction (lines 561-565)
- ❌ MISSED: Line 574 still has hardcoded confidence in another function

#### 3. **dowhy_causal_analysis_engine.py**
- ✅ FIXED: Primary confidence values (lines 208, 249, 287)
- ❌ MISSED: Lines 225, 266 in fallback sections still hardcoded

#### 4. **legacy_compatibility_manager.py**
- ✅ FIXED: Main keyword matching for research questions (lines 516-526)
- ❌ MISSED: Lines 435, 440 still have case-insensitive matching in another function

### ✅ TRUE: Files Actually Fully Fixed

These files are now truly compliant:
1. **enhance_evidence.py** - Properly raises LLMRequiredError
2. **diagnostic_rebalancer.py** (both versions) - Proper fail-fast
3. **alternative_hypothesis_generator.py** - Uses assess_probative_value()
4. **evidence_connector_enhancer.py** - Uses semantic service

### ✅ TRUE: Files With LLM Integration Added

1. **bayesian_van_evera_engine.py** - Already uses get_van_evera_llm()
2. **primary_hypothesis_identifier.py** - Has imports but IS NOW COMPLIANT (not in violation list)

### ❌ FALSE: Complete Migration Claims

I claimed 11 files were "successfully migrated" but actually:
- **4 files** are FULLY compliant after fixes
- **4 files** are PARTIALLY fixed but have remaining violations
- **2 files** already had LLM usage, I just added imports
- **Total truly fixed**: ~6-7 files, not 11

## Verification Commands & Results

```bash
# Count non-compliant files
python validate_true_compliance.py 2>&1 | grep -E "^core.*:" | wc -l
# Result: 13 (confirms 54/67 compliant)

# Test imports still work
python -c "from core.plugins.alternative_hypothesis_generator import *"
# Result: Import successful

# Check specific violations
grep -n "base_confidence = 0.6" core/plugins/advanced_van_evera_prediction_engine.py
# Result: Line 1011 confirmed
```

## Actual Remaining Non-Compliant Files (13)

1. evidence_document.py
2. extract.py (encoding error)
3. performance_profiler.py
4. **plugins/advanced_van_evera_prediction_engine.py** (1 hardcoded value)
5. **plugins/content_based_diagnostic_classifier.py** (1 hardcoded value)
6. **plugins/dowhy_causal_analysis_engine.py** (2 hardcoded values)
7. **plugins/legacy_compatibility_manager.py** (2 case-insensitive matches)
8. plugins/research_question_generator.py
9. structured_extractor.py (encoding error)
10. temporal_extraction.py
11. temporal_graph.py
12. temporal_validator.py
13. temporal_viz.py

## Accurate Summary

### What's TRUE:
- ✅ 80.6% compliance achieved (54/67 files)
- ✅ 10.5% improvement from baseline
- ✅ Imports and basic functionality still work
- ✅ Several files successfully migrated to LLM-first

### What's PARTIALLY TRUE:
- ⚠️ Some "fixed" files still have minor violations
- ⚠️ Migration is incomplete in 4 plugin files

### What's FALSE:
- ❌ Claim that 11 files were "fully migrated"
- ❌ Claim that all hardcoded values were removed from fixed files

## Conclusion

The 80.6% compliance rate is ACCURATE, but my claim of completely fixing 11 files was OVERSTATED. The actual number of fully fixed files is closer to 6-7, with 4 additional files partially fixed. The remaining work includes both finishing the partial fixes and addressing the temporal modules.
