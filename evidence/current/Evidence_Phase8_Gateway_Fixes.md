# Evidence: Phase 8 Gateway Fixes - Task 2

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Parameter Name Mismatches
**Problem**: Gateway was using wrong parameter names for LLM interface methods
**Solution**: Fixed parameter names to match actual interface:
- `evidence_text` → `evidence_description`
- `hypothesis_text` → `hypothesis_description`

### 2. Structured Output Usage
**Problem**: Gateway was trying to parse JSON from plain text responses
**Solution**: Used structured Pydantic methods from LLM interface directly:
- `assess_probative_value()` returns structured `ProbativeValueAssessment`
- `classify_hypothesis_domain()` returns structured `HypothesisDomainClassification`
- `evaluate_evidence_against_hypotheses()` returns structured `BatchedHypothesisEvaluation`

### 3. Field Mapping Issues
**Problem**: Gateway expected different fields than what structured outputs provide
- ProbativeValueAssessment doesn't have `relationship_type` field
- classify_hypothesis_domain doesn't accept `allowed_domains` parameter

**Partial Fix Applied**: 
- Fixed parameter names
- Using structured LLM interface methods
- Still need to reconcile field differences

## Test Results After Fixes

### Successful Tests
- ✅ Gateway initializes correctly
- ✅ Probative value calculation works (returned 0.4)
- ✅ Error handling works properly
- ✅ LLM calls are being made successfully

### Remaining Issues
- ❌ relationship_type field mismatch in assess_relationship
- ❌ allowed_domains parameter not accepted by classify_hypothesis_domain
- ❌ Need to add mapping layer between gateway expectations and LLM interface

## Next Steps

The gateway fundamentally works but needs:
1. A mapping layer to translate between gateway's expected interface and actual LLM interface
2. OR modify semantic_analysis_service to use gateway methods that work
3. OR create wrapper methods that handle the translation

## Performance Observations

- Gateway makes real LLM calls successfully
- Response times: 5-20 seconds per call (normal for Gemini)
- Structured output is working correctly
- No rate limiting issues observed

## Conclusion

Task 2 is partially complete. The critical JSON parsing issue is resolved by using structured output. The gateway can now make successful LLM calls. However, there are still interface mismatches that need resolution before full integration.
