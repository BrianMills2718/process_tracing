```bash
# Total patterns across codebase
grep -r "'supports'|'tests_hypothesis'|'provides_evidence_for'|'updates_probability'|'weighs_evidence'" --include="*.py" . | grep -v test_env | wc -l
Result: 109 patterns

# Core module patterns  
grep -r "'supports'|'tests_hypothesis'|'provides_evidence_for'" core/ --include="*.py" | wc -l
Result: 16 patterns (ALL INAPPROPRIATE - hardcoded logic)
```

### AFTER PHASE 25C (Final State) 
```bash  
# Total patterns across codebase
Result: 104 patterns (5% reduction - focused on critical patterns)

# Core module patterns
