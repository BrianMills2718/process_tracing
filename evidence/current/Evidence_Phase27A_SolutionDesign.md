=== SOLUTION DESIGN OPTIONS ===
=== EVOLUTION TEST SCENARIOS ===
1. Edge Type Removal: Remove 'supports' - should either work or fail gracefully
2. Edge Type Renaming: 'tests_hypothesis' -> 'validates_hypothesis'
3. Edge Type Addition: Add 'challenges_assumption'
4. Property Modification: Change 'supports' properties

=== VALIDATION MODE DESIGN ===
STRICT MODE (current): Fail fast on any missing critical edge types
EVOLUTION MODE: Allow ontology changes with warnings
DYNAMIC MODE: Validate based on actual graph content

=== DETAILED SOLUTION ANALYSIS ===

OPTION 1: SIMPLE EVOLUTION FLAG
Pros: 
- Backward compatible (default behavior unchanged)
- Easy to implement (single flag check)
- Clear user control
Cons:
- Binary choice (either all validation or none)
- Doesn't help identify which specific edges are actually needed

OPTION 2: DYNAMIC EDGE DETECTION  
Pros:
- Validates based on what's actually used in the system
- Smarter than hardcoded lists
- Self-adapting to code changes
Cons:
- Complex implementation
- Runtime overhead
- Harder to predict behavior

OPTION 3: CONFIGURABLE CRITICAL EDGE LISTS
Pros:
- Flexible configuration
- Can customize for different use cases  
- Maintains validation concept
Cons:
- More complex configuration
- Still somewhat rigid

RECOMMENDED APPROACH: Option 1 (Evolution Flag)
- Implement --evolution-mode command line flag
- Add evolution_mode parameter to validate_system_ontology()
- Maintain current strict validation as default
- Clear warnings when evolution mode is active
