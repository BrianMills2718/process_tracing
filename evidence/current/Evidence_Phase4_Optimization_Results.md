- L2 Semantic Hits: 0
- Approach: Comprehensive batched analysis

### Improvements
- **Time Reduction**: 31.9%
- **Call Reduction**: 50.0%
- **Speedup**: 1.5x faster
- **Efficiency**: 2.0x fewer calls

### Evidence Document Optimization
- Documents: 2
- Hypotheses Tested: 3
- Pre-analysis Calls: 4
- Total Calls: 10
- Calls per Hypothesis: 2.0

## Quality Validation
- All quality checks: PASSED
- Comprehensive analysis includes all required fields
- No degradation in analysis quality

## Key Achievements
1. [OK] Reduced LLM calls by 50%
2. [OK] Improved response time by 32%
3. [OK] Implemented semantic signature caching
4. [OK] Created evidence pre-analysis system
5. [OK] Maintained 100% quality standards

## Conclusion
Phase 4 optimizations successfully achieved the goal of 50-70% reduction in LLM calls
while maintaining or improving analysis quality through more coherent, comprehensive analysis.
