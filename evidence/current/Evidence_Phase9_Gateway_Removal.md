## Gateway Removal Evidence

### Files Deleted
- core/llm_gateway.py (contained keyword matching at lines 178-193)
- test_gateway_integration.py
- test_enhance_evidence_migration.py

### Reason for Removal
- Redundant: VanEveraLLMInterface already provides needed functionality
- Violates LLM-first: Contains keyword matching logic (`if 'contradict' in reasoning_lower`)
- Unnecessary complexity: Adds abstraction layer without benefit

### Verification Commands and Output

```bash
# Before deletion - file exists
$ ls core/llm_gateway.py
core/llm_gateway.py

# Delete the file
$ rm core/llm_gateway.py

# After deletion - file no longer exists
$ ls core/llm_gateway.py 2>&1
ls: cannot access 'core/llm_gateway.py': No such file or directory

# Delete test files
$ rm test_gateway_integration.py test_enhance_evidence_migration.py

# Verify test files deleted
$ ls test_gateway_integration.py test_enhance_evidence_migration.py 2>&1
ls: cannot access 'test_gateway_integration.py': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'test_enhance_evidence_migration.py': No such file or directory
```

### Result
âœ… Gateway and related test files successfully removed
