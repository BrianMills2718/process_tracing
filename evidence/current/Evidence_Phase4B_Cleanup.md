# Evidence Phase 4B: Dead Code Cleanup

## Cleanup Date: 2025-01-29

## Task: Remove Keyword Matching Code

### Search for References
```bash
grep -r "evaluate_relationship_lightweight" core/
```

**Result**: 
- Only found in `core/semantic_analysis_service.py` (definition only)
- No calls to this function anywhere in the codebase

### Code Removed
**File**: `core/semantic_analysis_service.py`
**Lines**: 433-491 (59 lines removed)
**Function**: `evaluate_relationship_lightweight()`

This function used keyword matching (word overlap) to evaluate relationships, which violates the LLM-first architecture principle.

### Verification After Removal
```bash
grep -r "evaluate_relationship_lightweight" core/
```

**Result**: No matches found (successfully removed)

### Additional Keyword Matching Check
```bash
grep -r "overlap_ratio\|hypothesis_concepts\|evidence_concepts" core/
```

**Result**: No matches found - all keyword matching logic removed

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE

All keyword matching code has been successfully removed from the codebase.
