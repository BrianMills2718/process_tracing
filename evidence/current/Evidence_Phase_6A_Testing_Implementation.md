   - Likelihood ratio consistency: LR = P(E|H) / P(E|¬H)
   - Prior-to-posterior updating with evidence chains

3. **Van Evera Integration**

### Mathematical Verification Examples

**Probability Conservation Test**:

```python  
def test_bayes_theorem_application(self):
    # Manual calculation: P(H|E) = P(E|H) * P(H) / P(E)
    p_e = p_e_h1 * p_h1 + p_e_h2 * p_h2
    expected_posterior = (p_e_h1 * p_h1) / p_e
    # Verify implementation matches expected result
    assert abs(actual_posterior - expected_posterior) < tolerance
