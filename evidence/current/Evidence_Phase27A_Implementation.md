Testing with missing 'supports' edge type...
üöÄ DIRECT ANALYSIS ENTRY POINT
===============================
Bypassing problematic python -m core.analyze execution

üîç VALIDATING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION...
‚ùå SYSTEM VALIDATION FAILED: ‚ùå ONTOLOGY VALIDATION FAILED: Missing critical edge types: ['supports']
üîß This indicates a configuration problem that would cause pipeline hanging.
üí° Fix the underlying issue before proceeding.
=== IMPLEMENTATION STEPS ===
1. Add evolution_mode configuration option
2. Modify validation logic to check evolution_mode flag
3. Maintain current behavior when evolution_mode=false
=== TESTING NORMAL MODE ===
