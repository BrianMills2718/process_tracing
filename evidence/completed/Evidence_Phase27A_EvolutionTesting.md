‚ö†Ô∏è  EVOLUTION MODE: Missing critical edge types: ['supports']
üß¨ Proceeding with ontology evolution - system may have reduced functionality
üí° To disable this warning, ensure all critical edge types exist in ontology
‚úÖ Ontology validation passed: 18 edge types
üß¨ Evolution mode active - ontology changes permitted
‚úÖ LiteLLM import successful

=== EDGE TYPE ADDITION TESTING ===
Edge type addition should work in both normal and evolution modes
Normal mode with standard ontology:
‚úÖ Ontology validation passed: 19 edge types
‚úÖ LiteLLM import successful

Evolution mode with standard ontology:
‚úÖ Ontology validation passed: 19 edge types
üß¨ Evolution mode active - ontology changes permitted
‚úÖ LiteLLM import successful

=== BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY TESTING ===
Testing that default behavior remains unchanged...
Without --evolution-mode flag (should fail fast):
üöÄ DIRECT ANALYSIS ENTRY POINT
===============================
Bypassing problematic python -m core.analyze execution

üîç VALIDATING SYSTEM CONFIGURATION...
‚úÖ Backward compatibility confirmed - fails fast without evolution mode
