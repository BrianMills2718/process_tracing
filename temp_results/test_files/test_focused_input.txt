The French and Indian War ended in 1763 with Britain's victory over France. 
    To pay for the war debt, Britain imposed new taxes on the American colonies including the Stamp Act.
    
    Historians argue that British taxation policies caused colonial rebellion because they violated colonial understanding of their rights as Englishmen.
    The colonists protested that taxation without representation violated their rights as Englishmen.
    
    This led to increasing tensions and eventually the Boston Tea Party in 1773.
