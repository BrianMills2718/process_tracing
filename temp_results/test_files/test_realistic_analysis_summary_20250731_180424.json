This led to widespread resentment and a growing sense of injustice among the colonists. This resentment fueled the formation and growth of colonial resistance movements, including boycotts, protests, and ultimately armed rebellion.",

The missing micro-steps highlight crucial processes like the colonists' response, the escalation of conflict, and their organization.  Therefore, the confidence is slightly lowered to reflect the current incompleteness.  The level of detail is also suggested as medium since many more details could enrich this causal mechanism (specific resistance actions, involvement of different groups etc.)."
