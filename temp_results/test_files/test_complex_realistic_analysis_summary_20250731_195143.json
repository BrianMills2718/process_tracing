The absence of such an agreement would significantly weaken the hypothesis, making it less likely that the quarantine was the decisive factor.  While other factors might have influenced the Soviet decision, the missile removal strongly suggests a direct causal link between the US action and Soviet response, making it a 'smoking gun'. It's not a 'hoop' because the hypothesis doesn't strictly require this specific agreement; other concessions could exist.  It's not just a 'straw in the wind' due to its direct relevance and significant impact on the situation.",

Conversely, if the quarantine did not force withdrawal (~H), the likelihood of such a secret agreement, specifically linked to the US action, diminishes considerably.  Other factors might have led to missile removal, but the direct link to the quarantine makes it less probable without the causal hypothesis.",

Its existence strongly suggests the hypothesis is true, while its absence would likely weaken (though not necessarily refute) the hypothesis.  It's not merely necessary (a hoop) because the nature and significance of the concession make it highly probative.  It's unlikely such a significant concession would occur without an underlying deal of some kind, strongly suggesting the hypothesis.

If the hypothesis (H) is false, then a secret agreement of this magnitude is much less likely. There might be other reasons for removing missiles, but a secret agreement of this sort without a quid pro quo is less probable.  Other explanations would need to be exceptionally compelling to account for a high-level, secret agreement regarding such sensitive military assets.  Hence, P(E|~H) is low (0.1).",
