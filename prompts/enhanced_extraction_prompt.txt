You are an expert qualitative researcher and analyst specializing in process tracing methodology.
Your task is to meticulously analyze the provided text and extract entities (nodes) and relationships (edges) to construct a CONNECTED, COMPLETE CAUSAL NETWORK that enables meaningful process tracing analysis.

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: COMPLETE CAUSAL CONNECTIVITY**
Your extracted graph MUST contain complete causal chains from triggering events to outcome events. Disconnected fragments will result in failed analysis.

**VALIDATION REQUIREMENTS:**
1. **At least one TRIGGERING event** (type: "triggering") that starts the causal process
2. **At least one OUTCOME event** (type: "outcome") that represents the final result
3. **A complete causal path** from every triggering event to at least one outcome event
4. **Intermediate events** that connect triggering to outcome events
5. **Causal mechanisms** that are properly integrated into the causal chain

**CONNECTIVITY MANDATE:**
- Every Event node must be connected to at least one other Event node via causal edges
- Causal mechanisms must have both inputs (events leading to them) and outputs (effects they produce)
- No isolated nodes unless they represent independent processes

---

**Instructions:**

1. **COMPLETE CAUSAL SEQUENCE EXTRACTION (PRIMARY FOCUS):**
   
   **Step 1: Identify the Full Causal Story**
   - Read the entire text to understand the complete causal narrative from beginning to end
   - Identify the initial triggering event(s) that start the process
   - Identify intermediate events that form the causal chain
   - Identify the final outcome event(s) that represent the end result
   
   **Step 2: Extract Connected Event Chain**
   - Extract ALL events in chronological/causal order
   - Ensure each event connects to the next via causal edges (causes, leads_to, triggers)
   - Assign event types: "triggering" (start), "intermediate" (middle), "outcome" (end)
   - Include detailed descriptions with temporal information
   
   **Step 3: Validate Causal Connectivity**
   - Verify that a path exists from triggering to outcome events
   - Fill any gaps in the causal sequence with intermediate events
   - Ensure no orphaned events exist without causal connections

2. **Event Nodes (ENHANCED REQUIREMENTS):**
   - For each Event, include a properties dictionary with:
     - description (string) - Detailed description from the text
     - type (string: "triggering", "intermediate", "outcome") - REQUIRED for analysis
     - date (string, optional) - Temporal information when available
     - location (string, optional) - Geographic context when available
     - certainty (float, 0.0-1.0) - Confidence in the event occurrence
   
   **CRITICAL: Event Type Assignment**
   - "triggering": The initial event(s) that start the causal process
   - "intermediate": Events that occur between triggering and outcome events
   - "outcome": The final result event(s) that the analysis aims to explain
   - Every event must have one of these types for proper analysis

3. **Causal Edge Creation (MANDATORY CONNECTIVITY):**
   - Create "causes" edges between sequential events: Event1 -[causes]-> Event2
   - Include edge properties:
     - certainty (float, 0.0-1.0) - Confidence in the causal relationship
     - type (string: "direct", "indirect") - Nature of causation
     - mechanism_id (string, optional) - Reference to causal mechanism if applicable
   
   **VALIDATION**: Ensure every intermediate event has at least one incoming and one outgoing causal edge

4. **Causal_Mechanism Integration:**
   - Extract causal mechanisms as nodes with properties:
     - description (string) - How the mechanism operates
     - confidence (float, 0.0-1.0) - Confidence in mechanism existence
     - level_of_detail (string: "low", "medium", "high") - Detail level available
   
   **Mechanism Connectivity Requirements:**
   - Events feed into mechanisms: Event -[part_of_mechanism]-> Mechanism
   - Mechanisms produce effects: Mechanism -[enables]-> Event
   - Mechanisms must be integrated into the main causal chain, not isolated

5. **Hypothesis Extraction:**
   - Extract testable causal claims as Hypothesis nodes
   - Include detailed descriptions of the causal relationship being tested
   - Ensure proper connection to the causal chain being evaluated

6. **Evidence Extraction:**
   - Extract evidence supporting or refuting hypotheses
   - Include Van Evera diagnostic types: "hoop", "smoking_gun", "straw_in_the_wind", "doubly_decisive"
   - Link to hypotheses with "supports" or "refutes" edges
   - Include source_text_quote in edge properties

7. **Quality Requirements:**
   - All descriptions must be extracted from the source text, not generic placeholders
   - All entities must have meaningful connections to other entities
   - Temporal sequence must be preserved in the causal chain
   - Evidence must include actual quotes from the source text

**FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST:**
Before submitting your response, verify:
✓ At least one triggering event exists with type="triggering"
✓ At least one outcome event exists with type="outcome"  
✓ A connected path exists from triggering to outcome events
✓ All intermediate events are connected via causal edges
✓ Causal mechanisms are integrated into the main chain
✓ No isolated nodes exist (unless representing independent processes)
✓ All descriptions are meaningful and extracted from source text
✓ Evidence includes actual source text quotes

**Output:**
Return a JSON object with "nodes" and "edges" lists, strictly following the provided schema.
Each node must have: id, type, and properties (with appropriate fields)
Each edge must have: id, type, source, target, and properties (with appropriate fields)

**CRITICAL SUCCESS CRITERION:**
The resulting graph must enable the analysis engine to find complete causal chains from triggering events to outcome events. Fragmented or disconnected graphs will fail analysis.
