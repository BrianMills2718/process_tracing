      You are performing the HYPOTHESIS FORMULATION phase of Van Evera process tracing.

      ## Rule 1: SINGULAR research question

      The research question MUST identify ONE specific outcome and ask what caused it. NOT a compound question.

      BAD: "Why did X radicalize AND conclude with Y?" (two different outcomes)
      GOOD: "Why did the Revolution radicalize into the Terror rather than stabilizing as a constitutional monarchy?"
      GOOD: "Why did the Directory collapse into Napoleon's coup rather than evolving into a stable republic?"

      Pick the outcome that the text's evidence best allows you to adjudicate. The hypotheses must ALL explain THIS SAME outcome via different causal paths.

      **CRITICAL for debate/multi-speaker texts**: If the text is a debate or discussion between speakers who disagree, your research question must be NEUTRAL — it must not adopt one speaker's framing. Frame the question around the OUTCOME or SITUATION that both speakers are trying to explain, not around one speaker's conclusion about it. BAD: "Why has Side A failed?" (adopts Side B's premise). GOOD: "Why has the conflict persisted without resolution?" (neutral framing that both sides' arguments can address).

      ## Rule 2: HYPOTHESES MUST MAKE OPPOSITE PREDICTIONS

      The defining feature of genuine rivalry: two hypotheses must make **opposite predictions about the same observable evidence**. If H1 predicts we should see X, then H2 must predict we should see NOT-X (or Y instead of X). If both hypotheses predict the same evidence, they are not rivals — they are either the same hypothesis with different labels, or complementary parts of one explanation.

      Each hypothesis must claim: "Factor X was the DECISIVE cause — without X, the outcome would NOT have occurred, even if other contributing factors were present."

      Every hypothesis must:
      - Claim to be the NECESSARY and/or SUFFICIENT cause of the specific outcome
      - Explain the SAME specific outcome (from the research question)
      - Propose a DIFFERENT causal mechanism
      - Make predictions that **CONTRADICT** at least one other hypothesis's predictions on specific, observable evidence

      **Complementary factors are NOT rivals.** If A is a precondition, B is a trigger, and C is a framing device, they are three components of one explanation. Merge them. Genuine rivals disagree about the causal mechanism itself — they predict different sequences, different actors as primary movers, different evidence patterns.

      ## Rule 3: Decompose compound explanations

      If the text says "A + B + C caused X," test A, B, and C as separate hypotheses. Which one did the DECISIVE causal work — the one without which X would not have happened? That's what process tracing is for.

      ## Rule 4: DISTINGUISHABILITY CHECK

      For each PAIR of hypotheses, you must be able to name at least THREE pieces of evidence that would support one but NOT the other. If you cannot find 3 discriminating items for a pair, the hypotheses are not distinct enough — MERGE them into one or sharpen the causal mechanism until they diverge.

      Each hypothesis's `observable_predictions` must include at least 3 predictions that explicitly name a rival hypothesis they contradict. For example: "If H1 is true but H3 is false, we would expect to see X" or "Unlike H2, this hypothesis predicts Y."

      Common traps to AVOID:
      - Two hypotheses that both involve the same key actor are probably not distinct. The distinction must be in the CAUSAL MECHANISM, not the personnel.
      - **CHAIN HYPOTHESES**: If H1 is a precondition for H2, or H2 is the ideological framing of H1's material cause, they are NOT rivals — they are steps in the SAME causal story. A precondition + a trigger + a framing device = ONE explanation, not three. MERGE and find genuinely different causal mechanisms.
      - **Simultaneous truth test**: If all hypotheses could be TRUE simultaneously without contradiction, they are not rivals.

      ## Rule 5: NO TAUTOLOGICAL HYPOTHESES

      A hypothesis must explain WHY the crisis resolved in this SPECIFIC way, not merely describe the crisis. Test: if the hypothesis is true by definition given the outcome, it is tautological and useless.

      BAD: "The Directory collapsed due to institutional instability" — this DESCRIBES the collapse. It doesn't explain why instability led to a military coup rather than another constitutional revision, a royalist restoration, or a Jacobin revival.
      GOOD: "Repeated purges of elected officials destroyed the legislature's legitimacy, making extra-constitutional seizure of power the path of least resistance for ambitious elites."

      The fix: replace the label ("instability") with the specific MECHANISM (purges → legitimacy loss → extra-constitutional action).

      ## Rule 6: NO HYPOTHESIS-FROM-EVIDENCE CIRCULARITY

      Do NOT create a hypothesis that directly quotes or closely paraphrases an interpretive evidence item. If the text says "Historian X argues that A caused B," you may NOT use "A caused B" as a hypothesis — because then evaluating that evidence against that hypothesis is circular (the evidence IS the hypothesis).

      Instead, decompose the historian's claim into a testable mechanism: What specific observable predictions does "A caused B" make that differ from alternative explanations?

      ## Rule 7: MUTUAL EXCLUSION SELF-CHECK

      Before finalizing your hypotheses, apply this test to EVERY pair:

      "If H_A is the decisive cause, does that make H_B unnecessary or wrong?"

      - If YES for at least one direction → they are genuine rivals. Keep both.
      - If NO in both directions (both can be fully true and decisive simultaneously) → they are NOT rivals. MERGE or reframe.

      The acid test: for each pair, identify at least one piece of observable evidence where H_A predicts one thing and H_B predicts the opposite. If you cannot, they are not rivals.

      ## Instructions

      1. **Research question**: One specific causal question about one outcome. If the text is a debate, the question must be neutral — do NOT adopt one speaker's framing over another's.

      2. **Text hypotheses** (2-3): Distinct causal claims from the text. Each is a SINGLE factor, not a laundry list. Set `source` to "text". In a debate, draw hypotheses from BOTH sides — do not derive all text hypotheses from one speaker.

      3. **Rival hypotheses** (2-3): Genuinely different explanations. Each should predict evidence the text hypotheses would NOT predict. Consider:
         - Structural vs. agency explanations
         - Material vs. ideational causes
         - Top-down (elite) vs. bottom-up (popular) drivers
         - Domestic vs. international factors
         Set `source` to "generated".

         MANDATORY: At least one hypothesis (text or generated) must be an AGENCY hypothesis — specific named individuals making deliberate choices that caused the outcome. Not "the military became important" but "Person X recruited Person Y and executed Plan Z." If the text names an architect of the outcome, that person's deliberate actions must be a hypothesis.

      4. **Theory-derived hypotheses**: In addition to hypotheses derived from the text and generated rivals, generate at least one hypothesis grounded in a relevant theoretical framework from the social sciences (political science, sociology, economics, international relations, etc.). Use your knowledge of established theories — path dependence, selectorate theory, collective action problems, institutional decay, principal-agent problems, offense-defense balance, etc. — to generate a hypothesis that the text's authors may not have considered. Set `source` to "generated". This hypothesis must still follow all the rules above (opposite predictions, non-tautological, distinguishable). If a user-provided theoretical framework is included below, you MUST generate at least one hypothesis from EACH provided framework.

      5. For EACH hypothesis (5-7 total):
         - `theoretical_basis`: 1-2 sentences
         - `causal_mechanism`: Specific step-by-step chain (1-2 sentences)
         - `observable_predictions`: 4-6 predictions that DISTINGUISH this from others:
           * What would we see if THIS is true but OTHERS are false?
           * What should be ABSENT if this is true?
           * What QUANTITATIVE pattern would we expect?

      Use IDs: h1, h2... and pred_h1_01, pred_h1_02...
