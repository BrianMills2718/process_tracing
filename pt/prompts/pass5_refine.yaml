      You are performing a SECOND READING of a source text for Van Evera process tracing.

      A PhD analyst doesn't read a text once. After the initial analysis — extraction, hypothesis generation, diagnostic testing, Bayesian updating, absence evaluation, and synthesis — you go back to the source with fresh eyes. You now know which hypotheses emerged, which evidence was decisive, where sensitivity is fragile, and what absence findings revealed. This re-reading surfaces things the first pass couldn't because you didn't yet know what mattered.

      ## Your Six Tasks (priority order)

      ### 1. Missed Evidence
      Passages that seemed unimportant initially but are now relevant given hypothesis competition and sensitivity fragility. You MUST quote the source text directly. Use IDs with `evi_ref_` prefix (e.g., `evi_ref_01`). Focus on evidence that would discriminate between the top hypotheses or address fragile posteriors.

      ### 2. Reinterpreted Evidence
      Evidence items whose TYPE or DESCRIPTION should change in light of the full analysis. Each reinterpretation must produce a concrete change: either `new_type` differs from `original_type`, or `updated_description` is provided, or both. Do NOT use this for evidence whose diagnostic power shifted but whose type and description are still accurate — that's just normal Bayesian updating. Examples of genuine reinterpretations:
      - Evidence coded as empirical that is actually interpretive (a historian's argument, not a fact)
      - Evidence whose description misses its real significance for hypothesis discrimination
      - Evidence type-coded as interpretive that contains verifiable empirical claims

      ### 3. New Causal Edges
      Relationships the extraction missed but that the evidence pattern suggests exist. Must quote a supporting passage from the source text. Don't add edges that merely restate what's already captured.

      ### 4. Spurious Extractions
      Evidence or causal edges the first pass extracted but that the full analysis reveals lack real textual support. Be CONSERVATIVE: don't remove evidence just because it's uninformative (LR near 1.0). Only remove items that are genuinely unsupported by the text or represent misreadings. For edges, use "source_id->target_id" format.

      ### 5. Hypothesis Refinements
      Sharpen mechanisms, add predictions, or reframe hypotheses based on what the full analysis revealed. Types:
      - `sharpen_mechanism`: Replace causal_mechanism with a more precise version
      - `add_prediction`: Add new observable predictions informed by the analysis
      - `reframe`: Replace both causal_mechanism and description
      - `merge_suggestion`: Suggest merging two hypotheses (NOT auto-applied — advisory only)

      ### 6. Missing Mechanisms
      Causal chains implied by the evidence pattern but not explicitly extracted. Must quote supporting text.

      ## Important Rules

      - ALL new evidence must include a direct quote from the source text in `source_text`
      - ALL new evidence IDs must use the `evi_ref_` prefix
      - Be specific and grounded — no speculation beyond what the text supports
      - Empty lists are fine — only report genuine findings, don't pad the output
      - Focus your effort where it matters most: fragile posteriors, close rankings, and damaging absence findings
