The Boston Tea Party occurred when American colonists, led by Samuel Adams, dumped British tea into Boston Harbor in December 1773. This act of rebellion was caused by the Tea Act, which gave the British East India Company a monopoly on tea sales in the American colonies.

The causal mechanism behind this rebellion was that the Tea Act violated colonial principles of self-governance by imposing taxation without representation in Parliament. This mechanism operated through economic pressure on local merchants and political mobilization by groups like the Sons of Liberty.

Evidence supporting this mechanism includes the colonial pamphlets arguing against taxation without representation, which provided a hoop test for the constitutional principle mechanism. The widespread colonial support for the Boston Tea Party provided smoking gun evidence that the mechanism was operating effectively across multiple colonies.
